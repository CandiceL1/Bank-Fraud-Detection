1,"I 'm no longer an account holder of SunTrust. I used to be until I realized how unethical of a company that is. Let me explain to you why I believe this : For years, SunTrust advertised and promoted in big letters their XXXX XXXX debit card. With that card, an account holder could earn XXXX mile for every {$1.00} spent ( for debit and credit card transactions ). SunTrust even advertised that they would not put a cap on a cardholder 's ability to earn miles.   Over the past XXXX months, SunTrust must have reviewed their debit card portfolio and what they did as a result of their review is shocking : They closed all account holders who had earned above average number of miles regardless of the types of products they purchased, regardless of the length of their relationship with SunTrust, and regardless of the amount of money in their checking accounts. I know of at least XXXX cases where SunTrust contacted XXXX XXXX to have the miles in the cardholder 's account reversed!!!   SunTrust is clearly engaging in what is commonly referred to as  bait and switch '', a marketing strategy of getting customers to sign up for a product ( that, by the way, carries a yearly fee of {$75.00} ) and then, once a certain number of miles are earned, the account is closed. This is unacceptable and a regulatory violation.   If SunTrust does not immediately stop closing accounts and reversing miles already earned, I 'll notify a well-known XXXX XXXX lawfirm to pursue a class action lawsuit against SunTrust and its XXXX and XXXX individually.

2,"After banking with Citibank for over 3 years, I discovered this evening that I could not use my debit card despite having a Citibank verified balance of {$900.00}. When I called Citibank, I was informed that the Texas branches had been bought by XXXX XXXX XXXX and as such, they, Citibank, could not allow access to my account. I was told I was notified of this via mail, though no certified letter or any correspondence showing I had received notification could be provided. Upon speaking to a supervisor, no remedy was available other than talk to the new bank tomorrow. I do n't feel I am overstating to say that this  customer service '' is tantamount to theft. Citibank allowed me to deposit my entire paycheck into my account 3 days ago on Friday, and on Monday denied me any access to my money! Like many Americans, I pay for most everything by debit card and rarely carry cash. How can a bank hold a persons money hostage, with no explanation other than I 'm sorry but we sent out letters? Ridiculous!   ",chen1331@purdue.edu,1
6,"There are two components to the bank fraud that I discovered this morning.  1 ) Wells Fargo changed my corporate bank account number without advising me.  2 ) A customer attempted to send me an electronic payment last Friday via ACH. I never received the payment. After contacting Wells Fargo, they explained that my bank account changed. I then attempted to determine when this changed by looking at the previous bank statements. When I pulled my XXXX XX/XX/2015 bank statement from their online banking system the statement reflected the NEW account number. I then pulled a copy of my XXXX XX/XX/2015 statement from my local drive which I had downloaded back in XXXX. The XXXX statements ARE DIFFERENT. Meaning, that the Wells Fargo Online Banking system is displaying incorrect banking information to their consumers ( i.e. fraud ). It is not clear because no one has investigated this whether this is the result of fraud, weak internal controls in their IT process or some other reason. No consumer should assume that the information they are receiving from Wells Fargo is credible or accurate.   ",dai77@purdue.edu,1

When they clear, even if cleared the same day or the deposit clears prior to the expense, an overdraft fee is assessed.   Additionally, it becomes difficult to track because of the disjointed design of the banking statements and online account view.   The statement separates deposits, expenses and daily balances.

On XXXX XXXX XXXX I discovered that {$600.00} dollars was missing from my checking account account and tried to stop the money from posting but because it was on a Sunday the teller said that she could not do anything other than stop my atm card until Monday. The next morning I went back to the tcf branch to file an investigation on my account because someone had used my atm card at a Tcf atm in XXXX Michigan but was informed by the branch manager that the bank could do anything unless I filed a police report with the XXXX police department because thats where the crime occurred. The next day I got a copy of my bank statement a filed a report with police. I went back to the branch to file the investigation with Tcf bank. The bank said that it would be easy to identify the person because they used tcf bank 's atm and they good camera systems. Next they ask me if i gave my pin # to anyone and I told them no! That I did not give my pin to anyone. Next they ask me if I suspected anyone told them no I do n't and that I had not used my atm card in a while since about XX/XX/XXXX but I had just went through a divorce back in XX/XX/XXXX its possible my ex wife could have got a hold of my card when she moved out and I did not authorized her to do anything with my card if in fact she was the person who stole my money. I told them that I have only XXXX card and no one else is on my account. The person who stole my money done a balance inquiry that cost me {$2.00} then according to my bank account statement and started pulling money out. The money that was taken made me short on my apartment 's rent so I had to move out. I continued to work with the bank asking if there was anything else that I could do the manager said no they have their own investigation department and they would be sending me a credit. I got a credit about 10 days later and a few days later I received a response from the investigation department asking for my account as to what happened and it had to be notarized and faxed back. I made another trip back to the bank and filled out the the investigation later and gave them the police report number and had the bank fax it back. Since faxing letter back I had no response from the bank. On XX/XX/XXXX I discovered that the bank had taken the {$600.00} back from my account with no explanation as to why so I asked the manager and she that my claim was denied because I benefited from the theft out of my checking account. At this point I was at a loss because I just loss my apartment and had not heard anything from the bank. The manager said that the investigation was sending me a letter as to their findings but I have not received any letter from them. Then she told me to file an appeal which I done. I do not think that it is fair to accuse me of benefitting from this matter. I followed every instruction from the bank to help with their investigation in a timely manner and ask to be kept in the loop and I heard nothing from them.

I was told that the charge had not yet processed so nothing could be done because the charge could potentially fall off rather than be processed. However, I had a new debit card issued in the meantime. On XXXX XXXX, 2014 the fraudulent charge was in fact processed. The charge was made to an unknown person in XXXX. I was in XXXX for my wedding and honeymoon from XXXX XXXX, 2014 to XXXX XXXX, 2014. Prior to my trip to XXXX I had notified Santander of my travel dates and since then I have confirmed with Santander that this is in fact on file. Additonally, I made a debit card purchase in XXXX on XXXX XXXX, 2014, which is evident within my back statement as well as the on the physical receipt I have for that purchase. Upon my return from XXXX, I called Santander to open a fraud claim. Within a week I was issued a charge back for the {$490.00} and a few weeks following that the charge back was debited from my account. I also received a letter stating that my claim had been denied. I then called Santander to request the documentation used in the claim investigation. It was at this time that I was also asked if I wanted to reopen the claim. I agreed to reopen the claim as I assumed that some piece of information was just overlooked. I was told that the claim results and the documentation would take approximately ten business days, however due to the holiday season and the countless days of in-climate weather that affected postal service, I waited nearly a month before contacting Santander once again. As it turns out, there was no record of my request for the documents or the reopening of my claim. So I placed the same requests for a second time. In approximately two weeks I received the documentation and another letter notifying me of the denied claim. Upon reviewing the documentation I came across contact information for the merchant who received my {$490.00}. The customer service number provided was disconnected, the email address was non-existent, and the merchant could not be located through any internet searching means. Also in the documentation was information showing the debit card authorization through a XXXX terminal that is listed as a  person to person '' transaction. I proceeded to call XXXX for more information regarding this. XXXX explained that the transaction was in fact  person to person '' meaning that the authorizing party would have to present the debit card to the merchant. The XXXX terminal used is not an online account, it is physical credit card terminal. Due to privacy policies, XXXX could not give me any further information regarding the merchant. I then relayed this information to Santander explaining that based on the  person to person '' transaction, I could not have physically been in XXXX when I was very clearly in XXXX on XXXX XXXX. I also explained that I had n't been able to contact the merchant himself as all of the information provided appears to be fake. Santander told me that nothing more could be done because they do not reopen a claim after it has been investigated XXXX. I then requested that the claim investigator contact me regarding this information. I have made this same request XXXX times now and have yet to receive any response.

155,I have been a Wells Fargo Customer since XX/XX/XXXX and have never experienced such injustice with this banking institution. On XX/XX/XXXX I called to check my balance and was shocked when I heard I had {$200.00} In overdraft fees. None of my bills are automatically debited from my account so that immediately did not make sense to me. When I spoke to a banker she informed me that my account had been debited for {$300.00} and thatts how I came to have the {$200.00} overdraft fee. She gave me the companies name and I assured her that I never authorized a payment. She then transferred me to the fraud dept and they assured me that my money would be returned including my overdraft fees. A few days later I called back to check on the case ( case # XXXX ) and was told by another fraud dept representative that the case was just sitting because it was not listed as an unauthorized payment. To add insult to injury my paycheck came in my account through direct deposit days later and the {$200.00} overdraft fee was paid out of my hardworking money.   ,bbrumfi@purdue.edu,0

The account became over drawn, which was an over sight on my part. The account was closed. I have been fighting with this for years and BBVA Compass have not been helpful. They never informed me that I was reported to a company called XXXX XXXX Services. The overdraft on my account was simply an over sight. It was no way intended to cause fraud. I went into XXXX of the local BBVA Compass branches and spoke with a branch manager and I was given a print out of when the account was opened and when it closed.

I am not a criminal and I have no criminal record nor do I have fraud on my back ground. I am a law abiding working citizen that made a minor mistake and its costing me dearly. Please have Compass review there records and remove this label from my name. This account was not associated with nor intended to be used in any type of fraud activity. If BBVA Compass truly believe this account was intended for fraud, please prove it. I dont owe them anything. And if BBVA Compass does not want my business, I understand but please dont make it hard for me to move on to another financial institution. This is so unfortunate and these kind of practises are intended to hold back the already middle class to poor. Life is a struggle as it is and with paying additional fees to cash my payroll check or pay for pre-paid cards is really hard on me.

Never told me they reported me to a place called early warning services for the very very old account back in 2009. I have suffered enough.

I recently had a situation whereby I had approximately {$450.00} in my account and a deposit of {$360.00} giving me a credit of {$820.00}.

Because of this practice, I was charged {$38.00} on XXXX checks for a total of {$150.00}. Whereas if they started with the lowest debt amount, which is how it shows up on both my statement and online, I would have only been charged XXXX late fee of {$38.00}.

Account representative was told that arrangements would be made to regain payment for this error from the person who withdrew the account ( account holder 's father ). Due to personal reasons and familial relationship to this person, the account holder waited until XXXX 2015 to open a formal dispute. The account representative at the branch in XXXX was visited and informed of the situation. This person contacted the branch that committed this error and instructed them of the error they caused and that there has not been a repayment of this transaction by this person withdrawing the money as he has recently been having health related issues and could not repay. They stated that they would make efforts to contact the withdrawer of the account and inform him of the need to repay this money.

During this call, the account representative asked about XXXX XXXX being possibly entered as a beneficiary and account holder agreed to accept this option.

The account holder then tried to prevent some overdraft fees when the debit card associated with the account was canceled on XXXX XXXX, 2015. There was no documentation to support the need to close the debit card. Then the customer service line was contacted that same day and told the account was deemed fraudulent and had automatically closed the debit card. The local branch was visited again and informed of all the issues with this account and that there was no resolution to the prior issue and had waited over 20 days to get a resolution to the problem. The account representative then qualified the account holder for a credit card to help avoid such large overdraft fees occurring by accident.

I advised him I needed several things such as ; cashing my check, making a deposit, and making a payment on a credit card. Unfortunately I did not get the personal bankers name. The personal banker asked if I had ever used the mobile app to make a deposit. I respectfully answered no. I advised the banker that I needed my funds today and I was unsure if I made a mobile deposit that my money would not be quickly available. The banker asked the amount of check and who it was from. I advised the banker that it was from my new employer. He asked why it was not deposited by direct deposit. I told him that this was my first check and they usually give a live check. I once more reminded the banker I needed my full funds today. Having that I had lost my job last month and this was my only cash that had came in within the last 4.5 weeks and needed to pay all my bills. Having that my bills were already past due including my car payment and rent. The banker advised not to worry that he would be able to take care of that for me. I dearly trusted this man so I used my mobile app to deposit the check in his presence. Once completed he then looked in the system and stated that only XXXX XXXX dollars would be available until the check was cleared for funds which could take up to 3 days having that it was Friday. I was speechless. I clearly had told him my financial state and he clearly disregarded it. I was very upset and I just did not want to be in this branch anymore.

The total payment I made was {$110.00} of which {$64.00} was late fees. This is an exorbitant amount of late fees and interest fees. The late fees make up for 57 % of the total payment.   To add insult to injury, I tried calling paypal. They put me on hold for an XXXX before I decided to try to reach out via email instead.   When I composed the email, the paypal site promised me a XXXX hour turn around. That was XXXX weeks ago. I have yet to get any sort of reply. I am starting to think that there is no customer service at all at paypal.   Another point of complaint is that the only way that I knew I had late charges was because they sent a letter to my old address. My address is up to date on paypal yet they sent it to an outdated XXXX. No emails were sent to me and no calls were made to tell me that I was overdue on an account.   This is fraud in that they forced me to use paypal credit when I did n't opt in to the account then charged me with late fees and offered no way for me to talk to anyone at paypal.

490,"I can not close my deceased uncle XXXX XXXX XXXX 's accounts at Huntington Bank because they will not recognize my unique position. I was Representative Payee, Power of Attorney, Medical Power of Attorney, and Executrix of my uncle 's small monetary holdings. He passed in XXXX 2015 at the VA nursing home. When I went to the XXXX County Courthouse in XXXX, WV in XXXX, I understood in this case that I could just proceed to follow the will without the lengthy probate process. My uncle was never married, no children, no property. All I needed to do as Executrix was pay the bills which I had been doing for years ( my uncle was in the Veteran Nursing Home in XXXX, WV at the time of his death ) and disburse the funds according to the will. These funds by will, were to be divided XXXX ways between his XXXX siblings ( or their families if they had passed first ). This I have done with approximately {$21000.00} of the total approx. {$30000.00} that existed at the time of death. My problem now is that when I went to close the Huntington Bank accounts ( one was VA administered through me, one was personal and Social Security administered by me ) and place the approximately XXXX left at Huntington into the estate account at XXXX XXXX Bank to disburse to the heirs, Huntington froze the accounts. This is not consistent with logic. After Huntington was notified of my uncle 's passing in XXXX they continued to honor my checks in XXXX and XXXX but now they can not? Apparently for some reason, even though he passed, I was authorized to write checks for those months, but now I can not close the account. Had I just written checks, it appears that I would have been fine, but there is some policy in place that prevents my closing the accounts and now I am told they are frozen. This is quite a predicament. I am well past the 30 days from demise for a probate process ; and the bank will not honor any of the means I have to prove that I am the responsible party to administer and distribute the funds. Since I have hit this roadblock, I have made appointments at the courthouse and with an attorney to see if they have any alternate advice, but I ca n't understand why there is not a process at this bank to verify my documents and proceed, as the insurance company and the other bank has been able to acknowledge. When I talked to the VA and the Social Security client services, they supported me in my belief that there should be a way to acknowledge my documentation and the federally appointed position I was in to administer my uncle 's fiduciary interests.  Since this roadblock occurred last Friday XXXX XXXX, I have talked to numerous levels of a number of organizations, even representatives at Huntington Customer Service were surprised at the opposition I was meeting. I was told it is a Huntington WV policy, NOT a WV law, and that the policy was administered by each branch of Huntington, I was even told by a Huntington team member to go to a different branch!  And now that I am being drug into a policy war, it seems, I am submitting this complaint in hopes that a reasonable policy can be put in place for this extremely rare circumstance that I am apparently in and also I hope for a personal remedy for my family.  Furthermore, this situation which is taking enormous amounts of my time, reminds me to point out the inconsistency in which things have been handled to date. Also, I want to point out that this branch was actually at fault for recommending and initiating a bank product for my uncle that a bank examiner voided out. That is why the major part of my uncle 's money was no longer at Huntington Bank in the first place.  Please find XXXX pages of documentation.   ",wang1768@purdue.edu,0
499,"This is the XXXX time I am complaining to you about the unfair banking practices of Wells Fargo in relation to their checking accounts. I accessed my bank account online and Wells Fargo showed a posted balance of {$190.00}. The asterisk clearly states the posted balance includes transactions that are pending, thus leading the customer to believe the posted balance is the remaining balance minus the pending transactions. So, over the weekend I purchased XXXX product for {$12.00} and then another product for {$5.00}, which are new transactions totaling {$17.00}. The new transactions totaling {$17.00} should well be covered by the posted balance of {$190.00}, right? No, I was charged XXXX XXXX overdraft fees for a total of {$100.00} to cover the {$12.00}, {$5.00} and another recurring {$4.00} transaction. The posted balance is a false balance and leads the consumer to think he or she has more money in the account than he or she actually does, So what happens? The consumer purchases something within the posted balance and creates overdrafts on multiple items, which is profit for the bank. ( I do n't think it costs the bank {$35.00} to  cover '' a {$12.00} or {$5.00} purchase ) Either the bank 's assertion that the posted balance includes posted AND pending transactions is purposely misleading or the posted balances are miscalculated. In either scenario, the consumer is primed for overdraft fees. This practice must stop and I am asking your Bureau to investigate and ensure personal checking balances are accurate within the industry. Personally, I believe I should not have paid overdraft fees since I acted on the posted balance as stated by Wells Fargo and I am seeking reimbursement.   ",jhaskins2013@yahoo.com,0

In my eyes, that 's unacceptable. Hopefully we can get this resolved. I have not received any notice from them about any charges or money owed at all. They have not once sent me a letter stating I owe them money, I have not received a phone call stating I owe them money. I also have not received anything from them stating anything about settling the debt, so that would go to show that they are not really trying to really work anything with me simply because they know they are in the wrong.They went directly to collections and went directly to tainting my credit. I would n't have known about this if it was n't for the fact that my husband is trying to take out a student loan and wanted me to cosign and the only thing stopping me is this USAA charge on my credit report. I know they know my mailing address because I still receiving mail from them at my current address because we never were able to close out our accounts with them completely because of the issue with the fraud dispute which is why we still to this day have not officially closed out the checking account.

I did n't even over draft. I simply did n't have the minimum balance to avoid a fee. The logic on this is backwards - if you have money, your checking is free, but if you 're barely scraping by, we 're going to penalize you by taking even more money out of your account?

Once I returned to XXXX I went to the XXXX and returned home to get some rest and recover. When we woke up the next morning, we had received several notifications that transactions had been approved on our debit card and that our savings and checking amounts had been severely depleted. We immediately went to a Chase branch to address the issue, provided forms of our ID 's and started the claim process. They assured us all funds would be returned in 12 hours, and that the card had been cancelled and there was no reason to close or freeze our accounts. Subsequently we received several emails stating the claims had been cancelled due to a conversation Chase had, had with me over the phone. This was not me calling, the only identifying information they requested in the claims and/or fraud department was the card number and PIN which they knew the criminals had after several conversations we had with them. Since the initial call from my wife and since the first time we cancelled the card and received assurance that the card could NOT be reactivated, and several visits to Chase ourselves, Chase has reactivated the card twice over the phone with a fraudulent caller and cancelled the claims 3 times allowing the criminals to continue to compromise and spend our money. How this is even possible I do not know. We have requested several times that any changes or request for information on our accounts had to be made in person with ID 's and calls needed additional identification like our security questions and as much personal information possible in order to take any action or hold any conversations.

On XXXX XXXX, we established a relationship with XXXX Bank and are now using them as our bank. The actions of US Bank were without warning or merit and were clearly unfair. This feels like a violation of the UDAAP standards. We are a family run business that has a strong history of support in our community. We had bills in transit, were assured that the online bill pay checks were not going to be issued ( but they were issued ), and ended up bouncing several checks since our account was closed without notice or warning. We also have payroll checks that are likely to bounce. We had to reach out to our vendors and employees to explain the situation to them. This is not only embarrassing but it 's a significant reputational risk to our business. We still do n't know the basis of US Bank 's XXXX decision. This is incredibly frustrating.

As directed by the rep, I called XXXX XXXX ( ( XXXX XXXX XXXX ) of the Loss Prevention Department. She told me that the funds were being sent to the IRS, but she refused to give me any information on which department of the IRS had requested this, who I should contact, or how I should go about getting the funds returned.

I asked him whether he felt that Ally had a duty to act reasonably in dealing with their customers, and he replied that they did not and that they could do whatever they wanted with regard to customer accounts. I asked him who had authorized the account closure and he declined to identify any individual, saying only  the Loss Prevention Department ''. I then asked him for the name of Ally 's primary regulator, in case I wished to make a complaint. He refused to say and suggested that if I had a complaint I should take it to the XXXX. Finally I asked him whether my wife and I could open a new account to deposit the check being sent by the IRS and he said he would get back to me.   Later on he called me to say that Ally had decided to close the checking account as well. Once again he declined to give a reason, said that Ally did not need a reason. Again I requested the name of the primary regulator and he declined to disclose it. Obviously these account closures have caused and will cause a considerable inconvenience to me and to my business.

I recently visited a branch XX/XX/XXXX to deposit a check and during that visit was told that my account is dormant. Apparently since XX/XX/XXXX up to this point, due to my account being inactive, I have been charged monthly fee of {$5.00}.  Since XX/XX/XXXX was Saturday, the manager at that branch was not able to answer questions on when did my account started being dormant, why there has been no communication from bank about it, I went to my regular branch ( XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX ) to inquire about my account. I wanted to check why bank have NOT notify me in anyway about changes to my account status from active to dormant. I also did not receive any notification that I will be charged fees for keeping this account. The bank representative told me that I have eStatements, and if I have logged in and checked my balance, I would notice that I am being charged fees.  I may have logged in to the account, but I believe bank eStatement are different that receiving notification from bank about account change. In my opinion, I should have received letter sent to my home address notifying me about charges that I will be occurring for keeping this account. I logged in today and tried to see if bank send me any notification via their system, but since they started charging me XX/XX/XXXX, I am not able to review any information ( see attached for showing no eNotices on my account ). The representative in the bank said that they can not see any communication on my account, but eStatements.  Attached is my XX/XX/XXXX eStatement. I do not see any explanation of those dormant charges ... there is a note saying that I can waive a {$15.00} maintenance fee if I keep certain balance on the account ( see attached ), however I do not think this applicable to my account.  However, there is no information what the dormant account means, when it started and what I have to do as customer to avoid this fee. I think this falls into UDaP ( unfair and Deceptive practice ), since bank did not notify customer of charges to the account. Yes, I could have logged in to the account to check my statement but I think with such substantial change of the account terms, there should have been a courtesy letter sent to my home address to notify me. There also should have been better explanation of the charge ( why am I being charged this and what I can do to stop being charged this fee ). I am very disappointed that bank would take {$95.00} dollars from my account. I can not believe that bank would charge me for 19 months a set fee and would not notify me. I know that they have correct correspondence address on the account, since they sent me a new ATM card. If I would have not go to the bank to deposit a check, I would continue to be unaware of diminishing account founds. At what point would bank notify me about the charges, when I would run out of money?  Please advise of best way to receive refund of those charges.

The bank was looking into archive to determine if they have a copy of signed letter in their records, as I do not recall receiving and signing such letter. As of today ( XX/XX/XXXX ), I have not heard back from bank about their research.  Thank you for your help in resolving this case.   ",hu417@purdue.edu,0

892,"On XXXX at XXXX I went to the XXXX XXXX Branch of Capital One Bank, where I have XXXX or more accounts : XXXX personal and XXXX business. I wanted to send a wire and check my balances. I was asked if I needed to update my information, which I did ( address and tel numbers ) on XXXX of my accounts. I was told that  I have to sign the change forms '', which I did. Afterward, I asked to get a copy of all the documents that I signed, and I was told that I could not have the copies. It was explained by more than XXXX employee, including the manger of the branch, that the policy forbids that they release those  internal '' forms to me. I explained that as soon as my signature was required, and I signed the form, that whether they considered them  internal '' or not, I was entitled to copies of my own documents that contained my signature. 3+hours later, I was told that the district manager would contact me, which she did. In the meantime, and since that time I still do not have copies of the forms that I signed, even though I requested them at each step.  1. I have asked or a copy of the policy or policies that explain ( s ) the bank 's position on refusing to provide copies of forms signed by a customer of Capital One to said customer after he signs them.  2. Though I was repeatedly told at the branch that this is  the policy '' I have been given no straight, unequivocal answer as to whether such a policy exists ; nor have I been told that the bank will provide me with that or any other explanation as to why their address forms or any other documents which contain my signature may not be provided to me.  3. I have been told that, according to the  office of the President '' of Capital One bank, and  XXXX '' who works in that department, that  there are no disclosures '' that delineate the policy regarding the bank 's refusal to provide copies to the client of forms he just signed, but that any details about such policies as well as whether they exist is an  internal '' issue.  4. The answer in # XXXX is an example of the doublespeak and equivocation that I am describing :  no disclosures '' in my understanding means no approved public material that the bank will release to explain their policy. That does NOT answer the question as to whether the bank is taking the position that they flatly refuse to make copies of a client 's signature and give it to him as part of ANY FORM that he signed.  5. Another example is when I was told that  if I want help from '' the office of the president that I 'm going to have to be specific about the  documents that I am requesting. '' I told them that  any form that has my signature on it '' are the forms that I am requesting in my particular case, but also:6. Because apparently the bank has a POLICY to refuse copies of client-signed documents to the client who signed them / this is a larger issue than just my particular case : The POLICIES as Well.  7. I repeatedly suggested that if the bank would simply provide me their policy which explains how and when they refuse copies to clients, or the REGULATIONS from the OCC or the FED that creates an exception to the obvious logical position that any responsible company or person would provide such copies, I would happily go on about my business.  8.

We were giving not notification and when it initially showed as pending we thought it was some kind of fraud. When we called PNC they said they could n't see the transaction until it posted. We asked at that point well if the account has been compromised what can we do they said we would have to wait until transaction posted to see for sure. In other words if account is compromised they ca n't do anything until transactions start to post which sounds preposterous to begin with.  After the transaction posted we called back in and they advised that it was due to charges to her old closed account. They could n't give us any details and even gave conflicting information, we were told it was all from XXXX old account and another time it was from XXXX old accounts, XXXX closed in XX/XX/XXXX and XXXX in XX/XX/XXXX. They would not provide us further information so not only are they charging us money but they can not even show us what it is for.  We went to the branch where we changed it over to a joint account and the apologized for the issue, that they have no way of seeing that when they change over the account, and that they would open up a complaint case for us. A complaint case was opened, XXXX, that was assigned to XXXX XXXX at XXXX, extension XXXX. It took a couple weeks to reach her but once we did she advised it was due to right to offset and there was nothing they could do since it is in the disclosure statement. I brought up the issue that they did not even advise us the money would be taken out and it was n't done right away and she said they would work to make process better but there was nothing they could do to refund the money. I also brought up the child support issue and they advised there is nothing preventing them from pulling from that either, that only social security and XXXX are protected. At best this is unethical but I do not believe the right to offset includes automatically taking child support so it borders on being illegal. The account that we have is based in Maryland which usually has much better consumer protection laws than surrounding states so I believed that they need to also provide notification before taking any money from account, not that they did n't have right to non-child support money but have to at least provide notification prior to taking it.  There have been additional issues in the past. XXXX in particular I have a large issue with is I wrote a check on the XXXX of a month. I did not see it post or even show pending until the XXXX. When it posted on the XXXX it actually posted on the XXXX. I had paid some bills early on the XXXX since I got paid and check did n't even show up against account yet. Luckily I had enough money in the account to cover anything but them posting an item that does n't show up on account at all until the XXXX for a back date seems highly questionable to me. PNC advised this was a standard practice and that you just have to account for check once it 's been written. I understand what they are saying but at same time if I see that something is n't even pending on account I should be able to use that money without fear of something being back dated on account.

1107,"I have various checking accounts at Wells Fargo and use the online payment system from XXXX to make payments by check, which is mailed to the recipient. Recently I wrote a check for about {$2300.00} to my insurance company for a homeowner 's premium. This was to replace policy I had paid for a week or so earlier with a better one recommended at the last minute by the agent. I asked the agent to hold onto the check until I had received a refund from the other policy, and she has kept the new check on her desk. But in the meantime, Wells Fargo debited my account for the {$2300.00}, causing the account to go into overdraft and impose a {$35.00} fee. When I complained, WF reversed the overdraft fee and explained that this type of payment is debited from the customer 's account on the date specified by the customer when the payment is ordered, but that the payment is not forwarded to the recipient until the check is cashed. The representative had no answer for why this should be different from the procedure with a traditional check. In my view, the bank is not at risk in this transaction, because it could simply refuse to clear the check if there were insufficient funds in the account, as it does with ordinary checks. I feel the process is designed to increase the odds of an overdraft for which a fee can be charged. It is similar to the practice of booking withdrawals before booking deposits, even if they come in the same day. This practice should be barred.   ",zhu316@purdue.edu,0

I found out when I received notification through my cell phone application that my account was overdrawn and saw that the {$300.00} promotion was also reversed. I had to transfer funds from my savings account to prevent it from being overdrawn. She then informed me that there was a disclosure that I had signed that the account had to be opened for 6 months. After I notified her I was not aware of it, she told me I had signed for it and that she reopened my account. She proceeded to tell me that she will call corporate to tell them she accidently closed my account to get coupon reversal removed.   After weeks of calling her, she told me she was not able to get coupon reversal removed ( XXXX/XXXX/2015 ). I questioned her about the 6 months policy and she told me it was written on the coupon.

At that point in time I realized I was not going to be able to make it to another TD Bank branch by the cut off time of XXXX XXXX, to avoid being charged several overdraft fees. So at that point in time I called TD Bank 's XXXX customer service number and after waiting for over half an hour, I was finally connected to a live TD Bank customer service representative. I explained what had happened and that same TD Bank customer service representative told me that I had nothing to worry about as long as I made the deposit at another TD Bank branch, on that same day, before XXXX, and he assured me that he was going to note my checking account so if by chance I did receive any overdraft fees, they would be instantaneously reversed/refunded due to the malfunctioning ATM, which the TD Bank customer service representative clearly and endlessly kept referring to as a bank error. So the next day on XXXX/XXXX/15, I received {$140.00}, worth of overdraft fees so I called TD Bank 's customer service XXXX number back and I explained my situation, especially the note that had been placed on my checking account the day before by the another TD Bank customer service representative, to the new TD Bank customer service representative that picked up my call.

1177,"To Whom It May Concern : Please be advised that the filing of this complaint with the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (  CFPB '' ) follows a summary complaint filed with the Office of the Comptroller of the Currencies (  O.C.C.  ), without supporting documents, and is intended to notify Bank of America (  BofA '' ) of my intentions to pursue litigation for unfair and deceptive banking practices as it relates to recording bank transactions ( i.e. backdating banking activity ) in an effort to charge additional overdraft bank fees. I 've incurred these overdraft charges as a result of either a broad and systemic bank issue or the bank has intentionally levied fees against me in the wake of a successful consumer lawsuit against the bank. The lawsuit involved a consumer credit reporting dispute against Bank of America involving the Fair Credit Reporting Act (  FCRA '' ) to which the bank was found negligent back in XXXX XXXX in the XXXX District Court of Massachusetts.  The following provides a summary explanation of banking activity involving a primary checking account and XXXX bill payments processed through the primary checking account that evidently occurred between XXXX XXXX and XXXX XXXX of XXXX. Bank notifications supplied by Bank of America call into question the sequence of the XXXX bill payments as well as the accuracy of the primary checking account 's balance on XXXX XXXX, XXXX which the bank controlled and therefore relied upon to charge the overdraft fees. The sequence of these XXXX bill payments and the resulting overdraft fees is neither consistent nor supported by customer notifications initiated by the bank to indicate recent bank activity and the primary checking account 's balance ( s ).  The primary checking account that my wife and I hold with Bank of America had a beginning balance of {$41.00} prior to XXXX bill payment transactions that Bank of America has reported as occurring on XXXX XXXX, XXXX. [ See Exhibit XXXX ] A payment to my wife 's XXXX XXXX account was scheduled to transact on XXXX XXXX, XXXX for {$30.00} through the bank 's online payment web portal. On XXXX XXXX, XXXX, I received an email notification from Bank of America indicating that our primary checking account balance fell below the {$25.00} pre-determined amount that was set by the customer to notify of low balances. [ See Exhibit XXXX XXXX The email notification indicates that the primary checking account balance of {$41.00} had decreased to {$11.00} as expected following the {$30.00} XXXX XXXX payment.  On the following day XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX XXXX, I received another email notification the primary checking account had become overdrawn. As the bank explains, the overdrawn balance was the result the {$30.00} XXXX XXXX bill payment as well as a bill payment for {$180.00} to XXXX. [ See Exhibit XXXX ] Based on the documentation and statements provided by Bank of America, I contacted their customer support center on the evening of XXXX XXXX, XXXX to dispute the overdraft charge on the XXXX XXXX payment and to request a refund of that overdraft fee.

Second time I called them I told them I did not recieve my check and they should stop payment. Their response was  give it more time ''. Third time I called them, I told them I still have not received the check and for them to definitely stop payment. Their response was, the check has been cashed and that I needed to go to J.P Morgan Chase and request a fraudulent claim form. I told them that it was their job, being that the check was not from my account. ALL OF THIS IS ON THEIR PHONE RECORDINGS OF ALL OUR CONVERSATIONS. I asked that they send me a copy of the check, it took XXXX approximately eight months plus numerous phone calls, to get me a copy of the cashed check. Their explanation of the delay was that they were transferring their insurance loss department to a new location in Texas and all paper work was in transit. Finally, I received a copy of the cashed check and as you can see my signature is not present and nor did I give any authorization to cash this check. I filled out the necessary paperwork to the best of my ability to get this matter resolved, which I will attach. All three banks refuse to take responsibility.  I believe XXXX XXXX is at fault mostly for not following proper procedures and taking and opening an account with an improperly endorsed check.  J.P Morgan Chase also did not follow proper banking procedures because they did not check the endorsements and released the funds anyway to XXXX XXXX.  XXXX is also at fault for not stopping payment when requested and simply not taking any responsibility or helping to resolve this situation in a timely manner.   ",mspanier@purdue.edu,0

At first they charged my account with the exact amount stolen, but they reversed this credit later, claiming that the PIN number was entered at first attempt and the card was used many times, adding that if it were a fraud case, the money would have been withdrawn in one attempt! They required me to send the flight information, which I then faxed, for opening a second claim. In the mean time, I made online chat with the Bank from XXXX three times and lastly had a call on Friday, XXXX XXXX. I was told by the claim department that the fraud case was closed irrevocably!  Long story short : my debit card must have been copied during my visit and misused after my departure.  The card is not stolen, it is still by me!

When my son noticed these charges on XXXX XXXX, 2015 he immediately contacted Netspend by telephone while all XXXX charges were pending. He was told to wait for the charges to go through and then call them back.   From there things only got worse and much more confusing. On XXXX XXXX, 2015 Netspend said they opened a dispute claim, # XXXX. They also told me via e-mail that  we will attempt to complete the investigation within 10 business days. If we need more time we may take up to 45 calendar days to complete the investigation. If we determine more time is needed, we may issue a temporary credit so you have use of your funds during the investigation.

They also claimed I did not contact them in a certain amount of time. They were contacted within one day of the transactions.   It is impossible to speak to a person in the  fraud '' department because my son was told by the phone representatives that the fraud department does not speak to customers on the phone. He was also unable to get a last name or direct phone number from any of the representatives he spoke to on the telephone. In the meantime they decided on XXXX XXXX, 2015 to deny my claim. The reason they gave for this decision was that they did not receive my signature.

In fact, my XXXX payment was turned down because of insufficient funds and I was changed a {$12.00} late fee when this happened.

1194,"Question : I need to know what has changed with CHASE.COM and scheduling bill payments. Something is different recently and I do n't know if this is because a regulation changed or if CHASE just changed their programming code in order to collect more fees XXXX.  Background : I 've been scheduling bills electronically for at least 10 years. So I get it. I know how it works. You ca n't schedule a payment to be made on a weekend day or holiday. If a payment is due on XXXX those dates, you have to pay the bill early in order for the bank to have enough time to process the payment.  Recently, ( this has happened XXXX to me now ), CHASE has decided to move my Bill payments originally scheduled for payday Friday to the day before my paycheck is deposited into my account. Then because I did n't have the money to cover all those payments the day before, they over drafted my account, charged some fees and moved the outstanding amount from my savings as the XXXX accounts are linked. The rep on the phone stated,  This is how all bill payments work even at other banks '' and because  they do n't want my payment to be late because of the holiday. '' Needless to say, I was SO NOT HAPPY. I do n't schedule bills to go on holidays. Then charging fees on top of it - to move my money over for no reason.

I searched for a phone number on-line and called. The rep on the phone was pleasant enough and gave me a one-time refund of the fees. Fine - but what about all future holidays? Is this happening to everyone? How many fees have they collected from people who did n't realize this was happening? Is this legal?  CHASE DOES NOT get to decide to just move my payments to another day. I decide. Do I need to close these accounts and move to another bank or is this happening at every bank that does electronic bill payments?  I would really like to know if this is legal and what I can do to avoid this problem in the future without having to go back to printing checks and the mail system.   ",mmaloof@purdue.edu,0

My husband spent hours on the phone with Netspend and finally the Supervisor told him  Not to worry, that the transaction has been cancelled ''. So today, XXXX/XXXX/16 I attempted to make a purchase with my Netspend card and the card was declined. I did n't think much of it, I thought more than likely they were having issues with their terminal. The card was declined again when I went to go buy lunch. My husband said I bet that {$800.00} transaction went through. I went to look at the XXXX XXXX XXXX to see if the {$800.00} was in there, it was not. So I signed on to the Netspend website and it shows the {$800.00} went through at XXXX on XXXX/XXXX/16, even though the supervisor assured my husband over and over that he cancelled the transaction. So I called Netspend to clear up the mess, and specifically asked for a supervisor. The 1st time I called the agent tried to assist me and told me the money is in XXXX XXXX. I told him it is not, my husband just got off the phone with them and there is no pending transactions and it is not in our account. I asked for a supervisor and after waiting on hold for 20 mins the phone just rang and rang. I hung up and called back and immediately asked for a supervisor. XXXX claimed to be a Floor Supervisor and I told him the situation and again I was told XXXX XXXX has the money. I again told him XXXX XXXX does NOT have my money. My husband just got off the phone with them and there are no pending transactions and the money is not showing in my account. I told him I looked on my mobile app, as well as my husband just got off the phone with a supervisor. I asked to speak with someone higher and XXXX told me if I do n't like what he has to say then hang up. After going back and forth with him about the money being in XXXX XXXX and I offered to email him my XXXX XXXX Transactions so he can see for himself XXXX said I am lying that the money is in my account. I hung up and called back and spoke with a Supervisor named XXXX who again gave me the same run around as XXXX. I do n't know what game this company is playing, but they do n't want to take responsibility for their mistakes and there seems to be no accountability. They have no regard for their Customers and go as far as calling them liars. I do n't know about them, but {$800.00} is a lot of money, that was my grocery money, gas money, and bill paying money that I no longer have.   ",cfeurtad@purdue.edu,0

1253,"XXXX. This complaint represents a new complaint against US Bank. This focuses on the XXXX XXXX District Manager of US Bank, XXXX XXXX, for actions that seek to discriminate against me as a XXXX person.   A prior complaint was filed XXXX XXXX XXXX against the XXXX Branch of US bank for refusal to accommodate my XXXX when XXXX tellers refused to help me complete a deposit slip despite my pleading with them for help and their mocking, shaming, belittling and embarrassing me ( teller even mocked me saying  oh I have pain toooooo '' ) in front of bank staff and patrons. After a phone conversation the next day with the branch manager, the situation was turned over to XXXX XXXX to handle.   2. This complaint arises from a separate incident on or around XXXX XXXX XXXX in which XXXX XXXX states he has no plan to take any disciplinary action against either teller or the branch manager for their refusal to accommodate my XXXX, rather his plan is to  move forward '' to which he explains that he wants me to return to patronizing the bank by asking for either the same teller name XXXX or for the branch manager to wait on me. He also verbally refused to take any of my solutions into consideration including a simple apology from the tellers. When I told him that it is traumatic, inconvenient and discriminating for me to have to deal with the same people and to have only them wait on me, he said that I need to move forward and try to work with the situation. When I asked him if he did any XXXX training with any of the staff or if he planned to, he said it was not necessary. He refused to listen to me further and said he needed to go. I told him I was not happy with this as a solution - however in the prior complaint he falsely claimed that I was ok with what he proposed. I am NOT ok with him continuing a new discrimination against me and having me being treated differently than other customers going into the bank.   ",ddye@purdue.edu,0
1256,"On XXXX XXXX 2016, at around XXXX, I signed into my Capital one 360 checking account because I was filing my taxes and wanted to verify and insert my account number so that my tax refund will be direct deposited. I noticed that {$2500.00} had been withdrawn from my account that same day. I called the bank at XXXX XXXX and reported the issue. I told the representative I spoke with that I am not the one who withdrew the funds in my account. The representative advised me that he will stop all withdrawals from my account and open an investigation. I told the representative to hold on while I transfer {$120.00} into my joint account so I can use for gas while they investigate. The balance on my account before the withdrawal was about {$2600.00} and at this point, only {$39.00} was left in my account.   I received a call from a representative in the investigation team the next day XXXX XXXX 2016. The representative asked me a few questions to confirm my identity. The representative asked me about XXXX deposits I made on XXXX XXXX and I confirmed that I made those deposits. The representative then told me that the person who made the deposit on XXXX XXXX was the same person that did the withdrawal at a Capital one bank in XXXX XXXX, XXXX. I told the representative that what she is telling me is impossible because I am in XXXX and I have been home the whole day with my father and children. I requested the video and the representative informed me that the bank will not be giving me the video and that I will need a detective to subpoena the video. The representative requested that I go give a police report and go into a branch, scan and send my drivers license by email. I did. This was a very stressful and painful process for me and the representative made me feel like the bank was partnering with the identity thief who withdrew the money from my account. I requested that a different representative should be assigned to my account and case.   On Tuesday XXXX XXXX, 2016, I received a call from another representative who notified me that the bank has finished its investigation and concluded that I am the one who withdrew money from my account. She notified me that the bank will close my account and send me a check by mail. I was very frustrated and did not know what to do. I went online and was searching for resources that could help me. I was late on all my bills, my credit was affected, I received late penalties for my bills and was feeling very sick from XXXX and confusion. I finally called the State of XXXX Attorney General 's office and spoke with XXXX who was very helpful. He gave me some helpful links to report the issue and sent me information by email and mail on what to do in the event of identity theft.   I am very disappointed in Capital One bank and the whole process. They really made me understand that they do not care about their customers. I checked the bank website and came to know that the XXXX XXXX XXXX in New Jersey opened at XXXX on XXXX XXXX and I called the bank from XXXX XXXX at XXXX XXXX on that same day. It takes 3 hours or more from my home in XXXX to the XXXX XXXX branch in XXXX, which means it is impossible that the person who withdrew the money from the account was me, even if the withdrawal happened at the same time that the bank opened. I requested a confirmation from my phone company, XXXX, and it is being attached with this report. I am also attaching the police report and the email I sent to the investigations team. Capital One Bank should apologize to me, refund my money and compensate me for the pain and suffering they have put me through. Please let me know if you have any questions.

XXXX proceeded to tell me that their policy does not allow to cash a check for a non-customer because they have no recourse if the check is returned. I asked XXXX to call the customer to verify the check and she proceeded to hand me the check back along with my two forms of ID as if to imply that the conversation was over. I then asked what if I opened an account, would I then be able to get the funds and she said yes. I was willing to do that and stepped over to the side while she found someone to assist. Ironically, she had to deal with another customer who was upset and was going to close his account due to fraudulent activity on his account ( makes me wonder what is Chase doing ).  I found this to be a huge inconvenience that XXXX was not willing to look at the totality of the transaction and make an informed decision. When she finally stepped out of the teller window I told her that I do n't have time for this and that the minute I open the account I would be closing it out and she said that 's exactly why they ( Chase ) do n't prefer to do transactions with non-customers.

We submitted the form and about a week later the account was debited for the over contributed amount plus interest and the fee was deducted from the account. We waited 10 days and did no receive a check. We contacted the bank and were told that a check had not yet been issued and contact them again at the end of the month if we did not receive the check because they were busy and can take up to thirty days to refund the money. Meanwhile no interest is being paid to us on the amount. They were not too busy to debit the account and charge a fee!

In the letter it says they identified that I requested an  All Debit Opt-Out '' in XXXX 2015. However, the letter states that the request was not submitted for processing until XX/XX/XXXX.

Instead the fraud department stated I would have to go after the individual who falsely stated to BoA that I made fraudulent payments.

1474,"My son, who is military, has had an account with USAA for 8 years and has never had any kind of issues with his banking or payments. In fact, he was an exemplary preferred customer in excellent standing. He also had his vehicles insured with USAA. He even bought his house thru USAA.  Recently, there seemed to be some unusual activities in and out of his checking account, over a span of a few days ... but nothing was brought to either my son or myself ( his POA ) with regards to these activities being fraudulent or reason for concern.Based on the nature of these occurrences, this should have been an obvious RED FLAG with the bank. Instead of putting this thru to their Fraud Dept., and/or issuing a temporary freeze on the account until an investigation was completed, they decided upon themselves to completely and without notice or warning, NOT to do business with my son any longer and restricted access to retrieving any information about the account altogether.  I happen to be a XXXX person as well as a XXXX XXXX, and I have been pursuing this matter on my own trying to find some kind of logical explanation. These were clearly fraudulent transactions and was not treated as such.  USAA is not a real financial Institution as a normal bank would entail but they are an Investment Corp. They do NOT have branches or locations for walk in service except for the one here in XXXX, TN which is close to XXXX XXXX. I went there personally on XXXX/XXXX/16 as I was told on the phone that they are not able to speak with me since they no longer do business with my son - which came as a shock to me. I informed them that I had spoken with CFPB as well as OCC about this situation and in doing so, managed to get a copy of the checking account statement which made absolutely NO sense to me as nothing was specified with all the charges racked up by USAA. There is so much more to explain after this. While being put on hold on the videoconferencing for over 10 minutes, I immediately got a call from someone on my cellphone who indicated to me that SHE would be the one handling this matter and gave me her name and direct number to communicate with her. Today is XXXX XXXX and I have never received a response from her even after leaving several messages each day. I have brought this to the attention of CFPB previously but have not filed an official complaint since I was under the impression that they were in the process of resolving it.  This does not seem to be the case as they have embarked upon a most unacceptable action that is affecting both my son  I in a very critical way. They have confiscated my son 's BAH, since he is in college under the Post XXXX GI Bill, and seems to be applying the full amount wired by The VA ED Dept. into his account, to all these fraudulent and made up charges by USAA. I can not get answers from anyone as the customer service people are very limited in whatever information they are told to give me.  I am my son 's dependent and have no other income to live by. I have been asking about the auto insurance and still can not get answers from USAA. I have explained that my son was not a beneficiary of any of those fraudulent deposits and withdrawals- if any - and his personal information may have been compromised as he had no knowledge of these activities. The bank even accepted fraudulent checks made out to third parties with USAA checks - not once, but twice. Yet, nothing seemed to be of concern to forward these transactions to the Fraud Dept, if, in fact, there is such a dept. with USAA.

However, recently, I have noticed that I am being charged fees that I did not originally agree to when I signed up for services. I have contacted US Bank regarding these illegal fees, and they have chosen to ignore my messages.   To prove my point, I have uploaded images of the account sign up process, including all account agreements and pages wherein one signs up for an account, opts out of  overdraft coverage '' and enrolls in the  overdraft protection '' service. I uploaded the contents to a website currently under development, XXXX Such a comparison is probably too nice, however, because XXXX XXXX actually disclosed his fees in the agreement fine print ; US Bank, however, did not.   Inside the overdraft section of the account agreement it states :  ATM and Debit Card Overdraft Coverage : Certain accounts are subject to a consumer 's election/choice to opt-in to receive ATM and Debit Card Overdraft Coverage. '' ...  If you do not opt-in, we will not authorize payment of an ATM or everyday ( non-recurring ) debit card transaction that could result in an overdraft status. In limited circumstances, your ATM or every day debit card transaction may be processed and your account results in a negative available balance, even if you have not opted-in to overdraft coverage for these transactions. These situations may include, but are not limited to, debit card transactions that post that are processed by the merchant when the merchant does not first obtain an authorization from U.S. Bank. If this situation occurs, you will not be charged an Overdraft Paid Fee for paying the transaction if you have not elected to Opt-In to ATM and Debit Card Overdraft Coverage. '' The  overdraft solutions '' section of my online account has always stated that I have been opted out of  overdraft coverage '' this entire time, yet they have charged me several overdraft paid fees for ATM check ( debit ) card transactions.   Reviewing the entire account agreement does not reveal that the account owner must pay a {$36.00} overdraft paid fee ( when fully Opted Out of overdraft coverage and opted into overdraft protection ) for ATM and everyday check ( debit ) card transactions. The  overdraft protection '' section in the account agreement does not state that enrolling in  overdraft protection '' automatically enrolls one into or overrides the account owner 's  overdraft coverage '' choice, either.   After signing up for an account, if one  opts out '' of overdraft coverage and signs up for the  overdraft protection '' service ( XXXX ), they are led to believe that doing so will completely avoid {$36.00}  overdraft paid '' fees for ATM and everyday check card transactions. Under the  Overdraft Protection '' and  Opt-out '' columns in the  How much does it cost? '' ( XXXX ) row, no {$36.00} overdraft paid fees for ATM and everyday check ( debit ) card transactions are mentioned. It does, however, mention such a fee in the leftmost  Opt-In '' column for overdraft coverage. It is reasonable to infer that US Bank specifically chose to avoid mentioning the {$36.00} overdraft paid fees for ATM / debit card transactions in the  overdraft protection '' column as doing so would most certainly deter a large number of people, including myself, from signing up for the service.   However, avoiding mention of these fees is certainly illegal as they are not outlined anywhere during the account sign up process, account agreement or  overdraft solutions '' section.   Thus, it took me by complete surprise ( as it should have ) when I incurred XXXX {$36.00}  overdraft paid '' fees on XXXX XXXX after an {$85.00} charge was attempted on my debit card   ",lo31@purdue.edu,0

On XXXX, XXXX, the local Chase Branch informed me that they have not been able to find my {$2100.00} and requested me to contact the sender to reissue me a new check without finding the ATM issue. This is unacceptable and irresponsible attitude towards this investigation and I can not accept their findings so far.   On XXXX/XXXX/XXXX, I went to the Chase bank to request them to access ATM to find my {$2100.00} check which was not successfully deposited due to ATM technical problem. The Branch Manager, XXXX XXXX XXXX, refused to access ATM for my check because I filed a claim over the phone and I also received the temporary credits provided by Chase on XXXX/XXXX/XXXX. I insisted on asking XXXX to check the ATM three times when I was there on XXXX/XXXX/XXXX, but she refused to do anything.   On XXXX/XXXX/XXXX, per my discussion with XXXX XXXX of Chase Executive Office over the phone, I have not obtained anything new from her and XXXX told me it would take 45 days till XXXX/XXXX/XXXX deadline for Chase to conduct their research and investigation without any detailed reasoning.   On XXXX/XXXX/XXXX, I spoke to XXXX at the local Chase branch office over the phone and he told me that he spoke to the Branch Manager, XXXX XXXX XXXX, and told me that they could not find my {$2100.00} check.   On XXXX/XXXX/XXXX, I went to Chase Branch and spoke to XXXX and showed him the ATM receipt that I obtained on XXXX/XXXX/XXXX. XXXX asked for another Chase bank rep to open the ATM and checked. As a result, they were still not able to locate the {$2100.00} check and asked me to contact the check sender to reissue me a new check as their resolution.  Chase would have more chances to find my {$2100.00} check when I was in the branch on XXXX/XXXX/XXXX, why did Chase Branch Manager refuse to access ATM at that time? Why did the Chase wait for two weeks to access the ATM on XXXX/XXXX/XXXX to try to look for check again? Why is the procedure to access ATM totally changed within two weeks on XXXX/XXXX/XXXX and XXXX/XXXX/XXXX? How could the {$2100.00} check disappeared without trace? Please request Chase Bank to show solid evidence with all of taped videos and ATM logs to investigate whether they have done proper procedures to protect customer 's assets and rights.   Furthermore, in XXXX XXXX XXXX, I had awful experience with the same local Chase Branch which is the closest Chase branch to where I live. The teller thought I occupied her time to deposit checks in the counter and asked me to do deposits at ATM. The teller seems she did not want to serve me. Due to this bad experience, I feel reluctant to go to the counter. That was why I deposited the check at ATM from time to time. Then the ATM got technical problem and swallowed my check on XXXX/XXXX/XXXX. Back in XXXX XXXX, I have filed a formal complaint to Chase Customer Service and I obtained a response from XXXX XXXX of Chase Executive Office dated on XXXX/XXXX/XXXX attached, which did not address my concerns/issues other than perform a formality.

I received no notice or notification about the change in my APY nor authorized the change with Santander or agreed to it.

I was never notified - no one called me, no one mailed anything to me - regarding this ... it just showed up on my credit report one day. This is not an act of non-payment.

The check was stolen and deposited into someone 's personal account at XXXX XXXX. It was not endorsed by the payee but instead signed by an individual. Yet Chase bank ( my bank and the payee 's bank ) honored the check anyway, took the money from my account, and paid the individual that was not the payee.   I learned of this the following day and notified Chase bank. They required me to fill out and submit an affidavit. Which I did immediately. Months passed and I followed up every week, then In XXXX XXXX Chase requested and affidavit from the Payee. That was done immediately.   Since then I have gotten the runaround, and still my money has not been returned. I have supported their efforts to find the thief, yet more than 5 months have passed and Chase refuses to return my money until they get the money back from the thief, even though they paid the thief, someone other than the payee. I have no control over that. There was no fraud on my end. No one claimed to be me, nor did they claim to be the payee. The check was stolen and Chase paid it without verifying they were the payee. This is their mistake, not mine.   I have called the Chase fraud department almost every week trying to come to a resolution, and they have no news or updates. For months they tell me they are researching this.   Moreover, they have been rude and even threatened to hang up when I ask for a manager.  I feel I have no recourse to get my money back other than to sue Chase ( which I really do not want to do ). And so two weeks ago I told Chase that I feel the only way I will ever see my money again is to sue them.   The next day I got a call from my bank manager saying that Chase fraud department told her that they are closing the claim because I threatened to sue them.   How can they do that?   Last week I called Chase 's Executive office and they said they 'd resolve this in 48 hours. Since then they have not called me back. I have called there two more times and I was told that someone would call me back that day, but no one has yet to call me.  I realize that I really do have to go to court to get my money back.

Unauthorized purchases were made starting on XXXX XXXX. I realized this on XXXX XXXX, 2015 and informed them that my card had been stolen. I had not needed my card for a few days since I was at home with my 3 month old and had not realized it was stolen. I went over all of the transactions with a customer service representative to determine which had been made on my card and which had been made with my husbands debit card since this is a joint account. The customer representative informed me that the total amount stolen from me was {$870.00}. I was told that a form would be sent to me that I needed to sign for them to start an investigation. I had the option of signing XXXX in person at a local branch of the bank, but between my work hours and taking care of a baby at home, I was unable to make it in to a bank during their hours of operation. I waited patiently for this form to arrive in the mail, but it never did. A few days after I made the original claim, my husband found my debit card in our house. I called to inform Huntington of this odd update in the case. The customer service representative informed me that this information would help them in the investigation and that someone could have made a duplicate card.   On XXXX XXXX, I received a letter stating,  We have completed our research into your error notification regarding the transaction ( s ) and have determined that no error has occurred. Please see below the information that was found during our research : +Debit card not reported lost/stolen prior to XXXX XXXX, 2015 +Debit card present at the time of transactions +Frequent history at merchant location ( s ) +Debit card used after transactions in dispute +Transactions made within vicinity of your residence, place of business, normal shopping locations, or you were in the merchant 's vicinity at the time the transactions took place. '' This letter also states the amount of money totaled {$850.00}, which is not the amount the customer service representative had originally totaled. These statements prove to me that their research into this theft was not thorough. Many of the transactions were made at businesses that I have never shopped at or even heard of. There were transactions made both near my residence and in other surrounding towns that I had not visited. Although some of the transactions were made locally, this should n't matter. A thief most definitely has the ability to purchase goods near my place of residence.   Some of the other reasons for the decision are just do n't make sense.  I am not sure what  Debit card present at time of transaction ( s ) '' is supposed to mean.  debit card used after transaction ( s ) in dispute '' could mean that I used the debit card that was still in my possession since it was never actually stolen or I may have overlooked a transaction in reporting the unauthorized transactions.  With a little more thorough of an investigation, they would have likely found that the signature on the receipts would n't match my signature and that security cameras at the places of business where these transactions took place would show someone else making those purchases, not me.

After observing the line and unable to quickly identify available seating for her, I sat her in a seat at the XXXX outside of the entrance, then I waited in line until a teller became available. The XXXX teller I worked with advised me he could not change my {$20.00} bill, unless I held an account with Wells Fargo.  I returned to my mother, and explained what occurred.

This teller appropriately asked for my mother in law ( as it was her account ), to which I advised she was near by, but was sitting as she is XXXX. The teller again reiterated that I would be unable to get the change unless I personally held an account with Wells Fargo. I then asked the teller if I was account holder with the bank would I be able to use the same {$20.00} bill I was presenting to obtain change? The teller advised me that she could, without issue. I then asked if my money held any value to them, being that I am not a current member of the bank. The teller clearly advised me that it does not. I then asked for her business card, as I was not happy with her explanation of the value of my money. I was receiving treatment as a XXXX class citizen, who 's money holds no value outside of the Wells Fargo. A XXXX teller quickly intervened, and advised me the same - that my money does not hold any value in his/the banks eyes, unless I personally have an account with Well Fargo. He then provided me his business card, as I left.  Are these deceptive practices in place to manipulate the public into opening accounts with the bank?  Would these same policies apply if I was a 10 year old child, who saved money in my piggy bank, and wanted to feel as an 'adult ' by placing a {$10.00} bill in my wallet, instead of carrying a change purse?

1690,"In XXXX of XXXX I made an offer to buy a house in XXXX, Maryland on a short sale. The offer was accepted in XXXX XXXX and was to go to closing in XXXX XXXX. On XXXX XXXX, water pipes in the unoccupied house froze and burst with considerable damage. The sale was put on hold.  The seller filed an insurance claim and was awarded funds for repairs, which were deposited in the Insurance Claims Department of Chase Bank.  I renewed my offer. About half of the insurance repair work was completed at that point. The reason the work progressed so slowly was that the contractor hired by the seller became difficult to contact and was dismissed after payment for the work completed. The remaining work was for mold remediation, floors and repair to the heating system. A total of {$14000.00} remained in the insurance claims benefit. At this point, my real estate agent informed me that it would be best to accept the remaining money rather than wait for the repairs to be completed because the house might be placed in foreclosure by Chase. With this understanding a new closing was set.  When we were assured the sale would take place I contacted a new firm to do the work needed for the insurance repairs along with other rehabilitation work on the house. The seller and his agent contacted Chase Bank to add my name to the account for the insurance claims benefits and I was told the bank agreed to this arrangement. On the day of closing the seller and his agent assured me there would be no problems accessing the insurance claims benefits which would be payable to the seller or his assigns. We closed on XXXX XXXX, XXXX, and our contactor began work on XXXX XXXX, XXXX. Shortly after closing I applied to Chase Bank to change the name of the contractor and to begin the process of accessing the funds. I was asked to supply the following ; Declaration of Intent to RepairContractors Lien WaiverInternal Revenue Form XXXXCopy of a certified letter to the original contractor, returned as undeliverableNotarized Hold Harmless Agreement from the SellerCopy of Affidavit of  Arms Length Transaction '' All of these documents were faxed to XXXX XXXX in the Insurance Claims Department XXXX Chase Bank. From XXXX XXXX until now I have made numerous telephone calls to follow up on this matter. I was told by Chase it would be necessary for  Corporate '' to approve the change of contractors in order to access the funds.  On XXXX XXXX, XXXX, I made the following series of telephone contacts with these results ; '' XXXX '' in the Insurance Office told me  Corporate says they will not release any funds until all proper documentation has been submitted. '' I asked to be forwarded to  Corporate. '' I was told to call XXXX.  XXXX XXXX at that number said he was in the Checking Department. He told me to call XXXX. Whoever answered that number told me to call XXXX, where, XXXX XXXX told me to call XXXX Customer Service at XXXX. At this number, XXXX XXXX referred me to  XXXX '' in XXXX XXXX.  '' XXXX '' informed me that  A VP wrote a letter saying the insurance money was not included in the short sale so Chase would keep the money. '' She said the letter was sent on XXXX XXXX ( a Sunday ) to an address in Arizona.  '' XXXX '' then forwarded my call to XXXX XXXX in the Insurance Claims Department who told me she needed documentation that the insurance settlement was to be forwarded to me.  Realizing that this is where the conversation started. I closed the phone call.  I have e-mail and fax documentation to all the information above as well as the account number in which the insurance funds were deposited at Chase Bank.  Based on those conversations, I conclude Chase does not intend to release the funds that are on deposit and instead Chase intends to appropriate the funds to themselves.   ",ahould@purdue.edu,0

Before leaving, I hired a dog sitter and her friend ( who had been referred to me by people I knew ) to watch my XXXX dogs at my home, collect my mail, and take care of my plants. I had given this person the key to my house. On XXXX/XXXX/15, I fly to XXXX, and did not arrive back to XXXX until late evening of XXXX/XXXX/15. When I arrived back home, I realized that my debit card had been used to make approximately XXXX purchases from my checking account with Capital One 360.

Since this has occurred, I have fought with Capital One tooth and nail, and even though I have sent Capital One a notarized affidavit of the XXXX charges not being mine, a copy of my itinerary, and a police report, they have continued to question each and every charge, making me send them the exact same paperwork for each and every single charge, eventually, finding in my favor for all charges, except for XXXX, which is the reason for this complaint. There was a charge for {$410.00} made on XXXX/XXXX/15, ( also when I was still in XXXX ) made through XXXX Online Catalog, ordered with next day delivery.

In addition, I had a credit from XXXX which I had just received in the mail a few days before I left, and which was sitting out on my desk by my computer for 40 % off. This coupon was used by the woman who also used my card. I suppose the bank found this somewhat strange that the person who used my debit card would also used this 40 % off coupon. However, I think that she was probably just trying to buy as much merchandise as she could with my debit card and therefore used this coupon as it was just sitting there, unfolded and open! I went round and round with Capital One about this charge, and XXXX of course disputed this. I asked Capital One how they could find that all the other XXXX charges were not mine, but that this one was?? THe other thing was that this item was sent by XXXX with no signature required??? That is strange in itself. The delivery slip ( attached ) says that the deliveryman was  met by a woman ''. That 's impossible because I was gone all day on the XXXX of XXXX, 2015, as I had medical tests scheduled XXXX miles away in XXXX. I did not take delivery of this XXXX item, however the woman I hired was told to leave my housekeys under my mat ( I have since changed my locks ) and they were there when I arrived home early evening on XXXX/XXXX/15.

Despite evidence proving complete mismanagement by WF, XXXX XXXX of the XXXX, MN ruled in favor of WF and levied {$35000.00} in court costs against the beneficiaries for questioning where the assets went. WF had an obligation to inform the beneficiaries of the asset distribution. WF has consumed most of the assets of the trust through negligence and inappropriate charges. Beneficiaries have received {$.00} on the dollar, 5 years after my father 's death, with little chance of seeing more. {$800000.00} of my parents ' XXXX XXXX have either been consumed or will likely remain unavailable. XXXX XXXX has grossly overcharged the trust by repeatedly  reviewing the file '', with no benefit to the beneficiaries as specified in trust law. The property manager, XXXX XXXX, repeatedly blamed the beneficiaries for Wells Fargo 's failure to sell the home despite Wells Fargo owning the assets of the trust. We are on our XXXX trustee. XXXX XXXX was appointed by XXXX XXXX.

Neither XXXX XXXX nor the realtor had checked on the property since the roof collapse in XXXX of XXXX. To date XXXX XXXX has not had the destroyed garage removed from the property.

My father 's will designated me as personal representative in the absence of WF, but XXXX XXXX ignored that. In response XXXX XXXX said that the communication was ex parte and demanded that I file motions with the court. Why would I expect a different response than the completely inadequate XXXX that we got before?

XXXX XXXX could scarcely have been any more incompetent at selling the home, his main purpose as trustee.  When I have explored other websites to report WF 's mishandling of the trust I was discouraged by the requirement that the issue had not been addressed in court.

Although we had been told initially that the hearing was an  evidentiary hearing '', it morphed into a trial with a trial attorney representing WF. The judge applied different standards to WF than to us.   ",sruddick@purdue.edu,0

1761,"The loan system of TD Bank is very confusing. I was rejected today by TD bank to waive the late fee after my best effort to correct a late payment situation. I then realized that it is TD Bank 's deliberate intention to create this confusion to make extra profit by collecting late fees on customers. For a {$2400.00} tax escrow late payment, TD charges {$160.00}, which is 6.54 %.   Almost all other banks I have dealt with either send a coupon booklet for XXXX month payments or mail a monthly statement consisting of both loan and escrow payment. In contrast, TD Bank mails out XXXX separate statements with XXXX payments due monthly. The XXXX is the escrow statement every month around XXXX and due on the XXXX of the following month while XXXX statement is for interest and principal payment around end of the month and due on the XXXX of the following month. Meanwhile TD requires the borrower to maintain a checking account for TD 's direct withdrawal.   Ever since I had this loan at the XX/XX/XXXX, I have always made my payments on time. I usually set auto pay for the ones with coupon booklet. For those which do not send coupon booklet, I rely on their statement to pay my mortgage because the annually changed tax escrow amount. However, the past XXXX, for whatever reason I did not receive XXXX credit card statements and TD 's escrow statement on time. As soon as I was aware of the lateness, I contacted XXXX XXXX, my account manager from TD Bank. He advised me to pay personally at one of their branch. So I did and also established the auto transfer to my TD checking accounts according to my best estimate. From my track record, XXXX waived my late fee and interest immediately after I explained, but not the TD Bank.  Before TD turned down my request, XXXX XXXX arranged a meeting with me and expressed that TD will need more business to exchange for this waiver. At the same time he also agreed with me that TD 's XXXX a month loan statements are inefficient and confusing.  When I followed up with XXXX XXXX on XX/XX/XXXX, I was told that his supervisor rejected it because I have no potential profit to them. I am shocked that a world known bank would handle situation only based on interest instead of fairness and principle. I have been a manager in real estate business for XXXX years, never paid a late fee. All US banks small or large are very reasonable. They base your track record and allow you at least XXXX time late payment leeway. Nevertheless, the TD Bank refuses any refund for the bewildered system uniquely from all others regardless if you have been a good customer so that TD can easily earn the extra profit whenever an oversight happened. The late fee of {$160.00} was only for the lateness of the escrow. I wonder if I would be end up with another late fee of {$170.00} based on the same 6.54 % calculation if the XXXX part of payment which is for interest and principal of {$2700.00} was late. As a reference, I have a similar amount of loan with XXXX XXXX XXXX, its late fee for both loan and escrow is only {$87.00} per month.   If a huge corporation like TD Bank has some ethic value in this business, I believe TD should at least give its customers one chance to refund their hard earned money and more importantly correct its system to clarify its parts of duty.

The bank would return a payment due to insufficent funds on one day/ charge a fee and then the next day approve the payment and charge an additional overdraft fee. This continued for serveral months. This caused large financial issue with my checking account. To the tune of having been assessed from XX/XX/XXXX to present a total of {$2500.00} in overdraft fees all to which have been paid. I have direct deposit and with each deposit the bank is paid for the fees in advance. In XX/XX/XXXX I was billed a total of {$770.00} in overdraft fees, XXXX {$210.00}, XX/XX/XXXX over {$200.00}, XX/XX/XXXX {$200.00}, XX/XX/XXXX {$140.00}, XX/XX/XXXX {$480.00}. I have attempted serveral times to speak with the bank about the fee assessment and have someone from the branch contact me. I was advised that someone would contact, I would get a telephoen call, would return the call and leave a message on their machine and receive no call back. The merchant in the past has done several things that indicate questionable business practices. For example during all of the fee assessments, there was an attempt for a merchant : XXXX, they were trying to collect on a late return of movies or no return. This merchant does get preauthorization with the initial rental. So when the movie is returned late or not at all they will go back into the credit card account used to rent to collect payment. I have recorded proof of a balance that was owed that the merchant attempted to withdraw {$60.00} ( approx ) with all of the fees I did not have enough. Ultimately, I only had {$11.00} ( approx ) in my checking account. The merchant miracously authorized the exact dollar amount. Then on the date of my deposit they come back into my account for the difference. I never contacted the merchant regarding the with draw or the authorization of a specific amount to resolve a balance. I was not aware that I had one with them assuming my children returned all the movies. The way it is discovered is that my account is impacted. The bank is double dipping and in the month of XX/XX/XXXX I suspect they were attempting to meet an end of the year quota, impact as may patrons during the XXXX Friday purchase/etc. I have been within the bank and heard that discussion. Also, I have had an incident where my account was compromised/debit card. Off of XXXX attempt with my card for a transaction out of the country they blocked my card.

Which was a grandfathered XXXX account which had no monthly fees regardless the balance. However that has not taken place, I get charged a monthly fee and they can not correct that either. So now along with the excessive fees they have imposed to my account I also now have monthly fees. This fees abuse has put me in financial straights.

Once I met the XXXX requirements necessary to recieve my incentive I called back in to PNC and asked them if I comepleted everything that I needed to. The representative that I spoke with let me know that all I needed to do was sign up for the workplace banking and in order for me to do that I needed to go into a PNC branch. I then went into the PNC branch and an advisor sat down with me and signed me up for the workplace banking. I asked him if that was all I needed to do in order to recieve my {$400.00} incentive and he said that I completed the requirements and should recieve my money within 60 days. Sometime around XX/XX/XXXX I called into PNC to discuss my new auto loan with them. While on the phone I asked about when I would recieve my {$400.00} incentive for signing up for the bank account. The representative looked over everything and let me know that I would not be recieving my {$400.00} due to the fact that in order to be eligible for that incentive I needed to recieve an email invite or an invite from a PNC representative for the workplace banking. I let the agent know that I was lead to believe that I would be recieving this money from multiple representatives of PNC and that I do n't understand how I am ineligible all of a sudden.

But think about it : there are probably hundreds of thousands, if not millions, of people just like me who thought they instructed the bank to pay their credit card balances in full, only to have the bank  adjust the payment on the back end '' WITHOUT INFORMING THE CLIENT, resulting in a finance charges in favor of the bank. They know this is happening, they know it is upsetting some clients, but they do not inform the clients of the adjustment or offer to repay the finance charges unless the clients call in and argue about it.

1871,"I was recently notified of a bounced check that I had written several weeks ago. I had been following my account online as well as the ATM. Upon looking over my account I have found that I in fact did have the funds available at the time the check was submitted to the issuers account. According to B of A I had several holds and money that was being processed according to them. I had made XXXX online purchase with XXXX and XXXX Restaurants equipment and supply 's. Both of there sites agreements say that my card will not be charged until I have received the items in expectable condition. Well from what I see on my account history is on XXXX I made on online purchase with XXXX. At that time they told me they just needed my Debit Card to verify the funds are available but that I was not going to be charged. So there is a processing charge on my B of A account and the money was removed from my available balance. Then the next day, same amount again processing and removed. This went on more then XXXX times until XXXX. It was not until then that the items were received. I contacted XXXX and they said the would be now charging my card. How my Bank could allow multiple holds and processing makes no sense. It has alwasy been my understanding that a hold will fall off in XXXX days if it is not first collected. Yet B of A allowed this to go on every time it would fall off they would either resubmit it or allow these companies to go against our agreement of XXXX hold to make sure that the funds are available. Not every couple of days for XXXX weeks. So apparently it was then explained to me when I called B of A that Checks are the last thing they allow to be processed and removed from my account even thought this is a checking account. So at the time the check was processed I had XXXX in my account but only XXXX was availbale do to all these processings and holds they allowed these companies to resubmit or took it upon them selves to do. So in turn I was XXXX dollars short on this check. I have proof that something very similar occurred awhile back and even though I have no overdraft on my account they allowed the funds to be removed even though I did not have the total avaible balance and put my account XXXX dollars. Why they treated me XXXX way XXXX time and another the next makes no sense. Not to mention we were traveling out of XXXX for a XXXX on XXXX. I had checked our funds prior. Yet at that time the XXXX process had dropped off and gave me a total of XXXX available. Well 2 days later they resubmit this XXXX charge and lionsdeal charge to the put me at XXXX with these companys being allowed to rehold my funds over and over again. This makes it very difficult for me as I am following what the company told me regarding not being charged until the items are delverd in good condition. Yet what I am seeing is banks are allowing these companies to remove money from your account for as long as they want. So when the hold falls off my bank resubmits these holds the next day or several. There is no rhyme or reason. The when I asked them why my check would n't have priority over some hold that has been removed XXXX times prior I was told that they had priority over any check. This in not right. So it is my understand that a business can hold funds and the bank will set those aside over and over. Yet I cant ask them to do this for a check. Not right. I write a rent check to this person every month for years. It is my most important bill. How I can not do what these business do on my own account makes no sense. Then I asked B of A why they did this as I have never bounced a check in over XXXX years. They said I should check my account more. They told me they do not call customers or put checks on hold as they do online. After speaking with my family who are with B of A I believe they are not following the rules. That is why I am submitting this.   ",hughe146@purdue.edu,0

1899,"In XXXX, I purchased a mobile home in XXXX XXXX, Louisiana. The home was originally financed, and subsequently paid off ( in approximately XXXX, as my own credit report does attest ), with XXXX XXXX. After submitting the final payment to XXXX, I did receive the paperwork and placed it as well as the cancelled check used to pay the last payment into safe keeping with my mother, because I was in the process of moving from the mobile home and into another house. Notwithstanding my naivety, that mobile home being my XXXX ever home purchase, I was ignorant to the fact that I alone was responsible for requesting that the lien be released, and no such instruction existed with the paperwork from XXXX. This did not become an issue until this year ( XXXX ), after laying either dormant or housing an occasional relative, a prospective buyer approached me, cash in hand and offering to buy it. Having no use for it and its age starting to show, I agreed on the spot for a mutually fair amount. Since I knew I owned it free and clear, I consented to the buyer moving it and we agreed that he would receive the title as soon as I could obtain the paperwork from my mother. Well, during the course of the deal, my mother 's apartment complex building burned to the ground, due to an electrical short per the Fire Marshall. Long story short, the  safe '' filing cabinet, and all but a few photos, was among the items that turned to magma by the time the blaze was brought under control and extinguished. However, in Louisiana, mobile homes are recorded with the DMV, because, since they can, in fact, be reverted back to a vehicle of sorts and possess a XXXX. Therefore, I went to my local DMV and requested both duplicates of the registration and title. It was at this time that I learned that the lien was still listed on the registration, and that until it is removed, a title can not be issued for the home.  Finally to the point ; to my surprise, it was NOT XXXX XXXX listed as the lien holder, but Bank of America, with whom I had never even dealt with regard to my home. I tried to contact the XXXX office in XXXX, MS , because that 's the address the DMV had on file, but that office had been liquidated. Then, when I contacted XXXX center, they had no previous record of the mortgage or it was  archived '' and unobtainable, and they recommended I contact BoA, which I did. BoA reps were very rude this time, and every instance thereafter, almost blatantly unhelpful in trying to help me resolve the issue. The only half-way useful information they have rendered, to date, is that my mortgage was likely acquired with thousands of others from GTF, and that it just happened that I had already made my final payment GT, who provided my docs, but that BoA actually had gained the asset.  BoA, upon running my social in their system, they concluded that they had never heard of me or the property, or it was /drum roll ... .ARCHIVED, and unobtainable, stating that if all I had was the registration and ID and that it would be insufficient documentation ... so, good luck with that ... bye!

One day there were XXXX charges for over {$450.00} and XXXX XXXX dollars within just a XXXX of days.

We called the bank and they refused to do anything saying we should have checked our statements more often. They said XXXX limits liability to XXXX days since the fraud began. We called XXXX and they advised us to call the bank and demand the return of our money since they were the ones who authorized the transactions in the first place.

For information regarding my initial complaint, which also involved my Rewards Money Market account ( hereafter, RMMA ), please see Case XXXX ( hereafter, Case XXXX ).   A brief summary of the facts associated with Case XXXX will facilitate CFPB 's understanding of my current complaint:1 ) After making a {$230000.00} deposit to my RMMA in XX/XX/XXXX, I had, as of XX/XX/XXXX, not received reward points for the month of XXXX. Historically, Capital One Bank credited reward points to my RMMA within the XXXX five days of the new month.   2 ) When I contacted Capital One, they cited a  bank wide system issue '' as the reason for the delay in reward points posting to my account, a claim reiterated in a letter, dated XX/XX/XXXX, that I received after this issue was resolved.   3 ) This letter also stated that the computer issue lasted from XXXX XXXX - XX/XX/XXXX. Note that Case XXXX was actually filed two days after ( XXXX XXXX ) the computer issue that effected RMMAs was resolved. Yet reward points were not posted to my account until ~ XXXX XXXX and Capital One backdated this posting to XX/XX/XXXX.   4 ) Finally, I know another individual who has a RMMA and he/she received his/her reward points during the XXXX five days of XXXX ( Note XXXX, below ). This fact appears to be inconsistent with a  bank wide system issue '' - if the issue was  system wide, '' presumably all RMMA accounts were effected, right?   Onto my current submission:1 ) On XX/XX/XXXX, I received an unsigned, undated notice from Capital One Bank informing me that my RMMA was being closed.   2 ) The notice did n't quite put it that way : instead, it stated that my ability to earn rewards points in my RMMA would end on XX/XX/XXXX and that the funds in the RMMA would be swept into a High Yield money market account in XX/XX/XXXX.   3 ) I received this notice 53 days after Case XXXX was opened. Retaliation for contacting the CFPB?   4 ) This notice arrived after a period ( XX/XX/XXXX-XX/XX/XXXX ) in which I had redeemed a high number ( Note XXXX, below ) of rewards points ( XXXX ). Possibly, Capital One 's attitude towards RMMA holders is,  Please, send us your money, because if you do then you 'll earn reward points (! ) but if you actually use a lot of these points in a short period of time, well, that will make us sad and we will close your account in order to foreclose the possibility of future sadness.  In terms of outcomes, I would prefer to leave my funds in my RMMA and continue to earn rewards points. Hence, I have XXXX questions for Capital One : 1 ) Are all RMMAs like the one I hold being closed on XX/XX/XXXX? 2 ) If not, then why, exactly, is my RMMA being closed?   Note 1 - I omitted this information from Case XXXX because I had not received permission from my friend to include it in that filing. Understand that my friend 's points posted the XXXX five days of XXXX - they appeared in his/her account during this period. In contrast, my points did not post until ~ XXXX XXXX and were backdated to XX/XX/XXXX by Capital One.   Note 2 - By  high, '' I mean relative to my perception of my annual spending on my Capital One Visa, which runs around {$16000.00}. A brief explanation is required : the rewards points referenced above are earned in a money market account offered by Capital One Bank.

2002,I was charged an overdraft fee on my checking account when it was not overdrawn. I also do not have overdraft protection. I called the bank to have it removed and they refused to even though my account was never overdrawn. This bank has very aggressive practices with regard to overdraft. They said the fee was for a pending transaction that had not been presented to my account for payment yet. This is one of the most ridiculous things I have ever heard. I have an attatchment of the exerp of my statement that contains the questionable practice by this bank. In it you will see that my account is never overdrawn except for when the fee was charged.   ,schwenk@purdue.edu,0

We did notice when opening our accounts that the WF branch had  NO SECURITY '' what s ever. The Teller cages are in the open and banking clients are seated side by side and required to discuss their private and personal financial matters while being subjected to sharing a closet like room with the bankers and WF clients. This is totally against FDIC rules for privacy and security. We 've brought this security and privacy issue to the officers at this branch and they tell us that the WF home office is working on a plan, but this dialog just keeps going on year after year. My wife and I work with a WF assistance vice president/personal banker. We 've had the recurring problem, that Wells Fargo will manipulate our accounts, allowing them to charge fees for what they claim to be insufficient funds. They even charge fees to transfer OUR FUNDS from savings to checking. In seven days XX/XX/XXXX the stole a total of {$82.00}. When we went into the branch to discuss this issue with our WF ass't VP/personal banker, at which time she left this closet office, where my wife and I are standing shoulder to shoulder with other banking clients. She returned with a woman we had never seen or knew and this person proceeded to get in my face and without privacy or security and ordered us out of the WF branch, in front of XXXX and the whole world.

2100,"So recently I have checked my Bank Account and found out I have a negative balance worth over {$500.00} from Wells Fargo. I am furious of the fact that they have never mentioned me about the overdraft protection fee when I signed up for Wells Fargo Debit card back in XX/XX/XXXX. I feel as if I have been taken advantage of just because I was still young at the time and I did not understand the whole concept of financial responsibility. It turns out as I checked through my previous months record there was also an reoccurring overdraft fee XXXX {$35.00} XXXX. I assumed a Debit Card was a card where you can use it as long as you have money in it and if you do n't happen to have enough money it wont go through. I recently found out about a overdraft protection fee yesterday and heard it for the first time. As I added up the total overdraft fee from last couple months of XX/XX/XXXX to present day it is estimated to be over {$1000.00} which I have paid without knowing any prior knowledge about  overdraft '' fees and this is just from late XX/XX/XXXX through present day. I strongly believe there were cases before XX/XX/XXXX where they charged an overdraft fee and I want to know how much they have charged me and want all the money back. I do not have an income and plus I am still a student in college working at a part-time job that only pays {$280.00} bi-weekly. I am upset and furious as a customer of Wells Fargo knowing that I have not been notified about overdraft penalty and taking advantage of me just because I was a student and young at the time. I am requesting Wells Fargo to give me back all the money I have given them ( overdrafts ) this past few years since I was a member of Wells Fargo XXXX XX/XX/XXXX-present ). This is not fair and I have done research myself and Wells Fargo seems to be known for their overdraft  scheme '' to customers if I may say. I am a customer from a low income family, accepted loans for education, and have a part-time job that can not pay off the negative balance I have with me right now. Again, I am furious and upset as a customer of Wells Fargo and want them to return the money back to me regardless because I have not been notified about overdraft protection the day I signed up for a Debit Card.

2125,"Commercial realty loan complaint against CITIBANK.   SITUATION. In XXXX 2007 I invested in XXXX, a Tenant in Common property in XXXX XXXX Iowa.

I went on vacation to XXXX, I tried to make XXXX withdrawals from XXXX different ATMs my transaction was denied a sign on the screen appeared which said, I could n't make withdrawals because my card did n't have a ship. So I took money from a card that did, the same thing happened the next day, and the same thing appeared on the ATM 'S screen. They charged XXXX transactions to my debit card even dough I did n't receive the money.  I called the bank when I noticed this happened to the number that appears on the back of the card which says : For international assistance call collect at XXXX, I called there because the call the number for the XXXX or XXXX did n't went through, my calls where for more than 20 min. to make the claim. After the second charge was made I did a second call, they said they were going file a claim for XXXX XXXX and they did this is my claim reference XXXX. XXXX, and this is in Wells Fargo. They did put a provisional credit for ATM claim for {$190.00} dollars, this was the sum of XXXX transactions. When I got back to the XXXX. I noticed I had charges for over XXXX dollars on the cell phone statement because of the calls, is n't a collect call supposed to be a call where the company you are calling is going to be charged for the call. I called the phone company and they said I had to call the bank so they could pay for the calls, I called the bank and they would n't get take responsibility, they said the collect call must be done from a local phone, which is not specified on the back of the card.  They passed then I get this letter from Wells Fargo that says my claim is being investigated. Yesterday I checked my statement and I had negative numbers on that account which I decided not to use after all this happened. I decided to use credit instead of debit maybe this way they will take proper actions. Well yesterday I say this transaction which said REVERSAL OF CREDIT FOR ATM CLAIM XXXX for {$190.00}, same amount they added before as provisional credit now they were taking it back.  I saw and email which said : We have completed your investigation of the claim regarding your Wells Fargo account. We sent a detailed letter by mail. Please refer to the letter for more information.

I looked for another number in which my call was attended after 20 min. the lady that answered was not helpful I asked her what happened she said the bank had to reverse the credit because the bank in XXXX would n't return the money. I asked to talk to her manager he said the same thing and they could n't do anything about it.  My claim here is to the bank Wells Fargo, they did n't do the correct investigations on my claim, if they would have done the correct thing they would have noticed I never got that money, now I have my account in negative numbers because the money I deposited was taken from another bank, they even told me I should arrange this with the bank in XXXX, and know I have to make another deposit for the same amount they took from me so I wo n't have a bad credit score and pay for more than XXXX dollars for phone calls that are supposed to be free.

We value long standing relationships, and it is the only thing that has prevented us from moving our account thus far but our frustration with these practices are pushing us to consider switching our accounts to a new financial institution.  It seems that since the new financial protections were put in place for consumers that restricts financial institutions from collecting or racking up arbitrary fees, that our bank has instituted a new way to collect these fees and revenue they have lost that are equally arbitrary and at a minimum are performed in a cloak and dagger fashion.  When we notice through online banking that our checking acct is running low on funds to cover checks or payments that we know we initiated but that do not yet appear to have been submitted to our account, we drive immediately to our local BB  T branch with cash in hand to deposit into our account. When we arrive, we always first inquire with the bank rep and verify that there are no  returned payments '' noted on our account. We then immediately deposit the cash that would then cover those payments. We then would notice repeatedly that when the bank performed their reconciliation processes after midnight of that same day that they would then first report a payment from a company was submitted and returned that same day and that they returned the payment to the submitter and charged a {$35.00} fee to our account and they would then go on to reflect on the next reconciliation line that they received the cash deposit made earlier that day  after the returned payment ''. I have spoken to bank reps repeatedly re this discrepancy between what we are told by their bank rep that no payments had been submitted and returned at the point of us making that cash deposit and then their coming back to us after their after midnight reconciliation process that indeed a payment had been submitted and returned that day and that they then state to me that it was submitted and returned  before '' we made the cash deposit and that the {$35.00} fee was deducted from our checking acct. This unfortunately has happened too many times for it to be a one off innocent error, and appears to instead be a new bait and switch technique for financial institutes to continue to recoup the arbitrary fees they had been supposedly prevented from recouping through the new consumer protections put in place. Very few times the bank rep was kind enough to deposit back the fee because many times it was the same rep I had originally spoken to when I was depositing the cash to cover the payments that I then spoke to later when I noticed this bait and switch technique and that the outcome did not comport with what she had advised me initially.

And Section 1 as follows :  no such fee shall be charged, unless the consumer has expressly elected to permit the creditor, with respect to such account, to complete transactions involving the extension of credit under such account in excess of the amount of credit authorized. '' I did not, and I opted out of their overdraft already.   Furthermore, section 2 as follows : ' ( 2 ) DISCLOSURE BY CREDITOR. -- No election by a consumer under paragraph ( 1 ) shall take effect unless the consumer, before making such election, received a notice from the creditor of any over-the-limit fee in the form and manner ... '' Pertaining to re-ordering transactions, regulations section XXXX as follows : ' ( B ) [ Law shall ] prevent unfair or deceptive acts or practices in connection with the manipulation of credit limits designed to increase over-the-limit fees or other penalty fees.

2555,"Dear Sir/Madam, I am writing to express my concerns about a behavior of Scottrade Bank and their affiliates which may have adversely exposed my personal information and lead to identity theft and fraud.   Specifically, in going through my records in order to better understand how I could resolve ongoing identity theft, I discovered that when applying for a bank account at Scottrade Bank, Scottrade Bank improperly handled a number of documents which had very personal information on them. The actions of Scottrade Bank not only broke from the current standards of data security but also broke Scottrade Bank 's internal policies regarding handling customer information.   Specifically, on or around XXXX XXXX, 2013 ( XXXX XXXX ), XXXX XXXX, a regional manager from Scottrade Bank offered to receive Scottrade Bank account application documents via email. Email is a notoriously insecure medium of communication yet XXXX XXXX allowed and offered to receive the documents via email, despite the fact that it was against Scottrade Bank 's internal policies and does not have any of the normal safeguards in place to handle personal customer information. The XXXX XXXX, 2013 email contained PDF attachments that included my full name, signature, address, bank account numbers, Social Security Number, and other very personal and sensitive information.   As is clear by Scottrade 's online disclosures and policies, Scottrade Bank states that it will never transmit customer information over email and or ask for or receive personal information via email, however, XXXX XXXX, a manager at Scottrade encouraged me to send the information by email to expedite the process, with no disclose of the security concerns.   I am writing today to ask Scottrade to explain why they let my personal information be transmitted in a way that puts me at significant risk to identity theft. I would also like to know what the current status of the email and personal information is, has it been deleted, has it been accessed, are emails records secure, who could have gained access, was the email accessed via HTTP or HTTPS, was it confirmed a secure connection?

2561,"I have XXXX issues with Bank of America. I have my main checking account with them, and I use that checking account to pay all my credit card payments, and I have over a dozen active cards with NEVER EVER ANY MISSED OR LATE PAYMENTS. I log on once a week to all my accounts to verify the balances, and after I make my monthly payments, I WRITE DOWN THE AMOUNT AND DATE. Unfortunately, BofA has an app that does n't give any details about accounts such as statements, no means to email the bank either, and the website is n't any better as from the dozens of institutions I deal with online, BofA is the ONLY ONE NOT TO GIVE YOU A  FULL SITE OPTION ''.   I also have a credit card account at BofA, so instead of payments, I do a transfer from my checking account to my credit card account, and the transfer gets credited as a payment ( I have been doing it for 10 years with XXXX problem during the transfer about 8 years ago when I still lived in Nevada ).   On XXXX XXXX, 2015, I logged on to my BofA app, and I made a transfer of {$30.00} from my checking to my credit card account. The app crashed shortly after that while I was scrolling through my checking account transactions, and when I tried logging back on, it asked me to update the app, stating I had an old version ( I was using a different wifi phone ). You may be in an emergency with a slow connection, and they will NOT LET YOU ONLINE UNLESS YOU DOWNLOAD THE NEW VERSION, which would have taken me quite a while on a XXXX connection, so I did n't as I did n't have half an hour to waste and that was it. I doubt they suddenly had an app update right while I was using the app but who knows. Unlike my other cards, I check BofA maybe 3 times a month as I would rather not use that app, and it 's usually early in the month ( I get about a {$3000.00} inbound transfer at the beginning of every month from the rental for my houses, and that I verify the first week of the month ), and then to make my transfer and then maybe one more time.   I logged on yesterday to make my payment, and it showed me as having MISSED A PAYMENT for XXXX. There is no indication that I made the transfer even though I HAVE IT WRITTEN DOWN AS PAID AFTER MAKING THE TRANSFER ( I am neither stupid nor senile not to know when I make a payment ). In the meanwhile, I did NOT get a single notice or call about having missed a payment either, so it was a bit of a surprise. However, BofA keeps logs of when their customers log on, and what pages they go to when they are online, so it should n't be a problem to check the logs for XXXX XXXX to see that I was on the transfer page. Whether the site had problems, or whether it was the app, that is not my problem, I made my regular payment as I have been for the past 10 years or so, so I would like that transfer to be honored. If not, I am going to be closing my account as I am about done, and it would be a good opportunity to never use that app again.   The other issue is that I have a yearly fee for my credit card in the amount of {$29.00} which is charged in XXXX to my account. I went through 6 months of statements to see if there were other payment issues with the app, and I noticed that I was being charged 29.59 % interest on the MANDATORY BANK FEE which showed AS A PURCHASE. It may not be much to pay 29.59 % interest on {$29.00} dollars but the fact of the matter is that the {$29.00} balance is a bank forced fee, and it is NOT a purchase. So why should I even pay any interest on {$29.00}? Plus, are n't banks supposed to credit your payments towards higher interest balances first? If it is so, the fee was charged in XXXX, and my next payment of {$30.00} should have paid the whole thing off, not to mention I had XXXX more payments after that ( XXXX if the  missing one '' does n't count ). Either way, if they do that to a few XXXX customers, they are suddenly earning XXXX of XXXX of UNJUST INTEREST, and I have an issue with that.   ",schwenk@purdue.edu,0

2642,"Over the past month I have written many complaints against Key Bank. I am writing this last complaint to simply sum up the issues that I have with this bank. I hope that the bank will be audited for excessive overdrafting again in the future. I had XXXX accounts with Key Bank, a personal checking account and a Hassle Free account. The Hassle Free account was attached to my personal checking account as an account that my teenaged son could use. He is a XXXX since he was just turning XXXX. The Hassle Free account issued a debit card with his name and I was able to transfer funds from my account to his account easily. Often, I would get very close to a XXXX balance as I live pay check to paycheck. Often I would deposit money through an ATM machine which would theoretically give me access to XXXX dollars immediately. However, through Key Bank 's magical accounting system, when the ledger would be managed by the bank, items would bounce because actually there was not immediate access to the money through the on line account.   I have several copies of my account and my son 's account as the bank was performing its processing during the evening and night hours. Often, the ledger shows a huge negative balance while the processing is happening. It 's hard to understand how a large modern bank like this has such antiquated accounting processes. I have an account in another bank and all transactions are immediate and neat. There is no messy, convoluted, unclear and dishonest practice that results in excessive overdrafts.   Anyway, the result of my complaining was that Key Bank closed my checking account. I did not ask for this. This created complete havoc in my financial life. I had to stop direct deposits and go to another bank to open an account for me and my son. When I talked to XXXX the representative of Key Bank who closed my account she did not even understand that the Hassle Free Account was my son 's and was connected to my personal account. She was going to leave the Hassle Free account open. So not only does key bank participate in magical accounting that results in excessive overdrafts for folks, but key bank also does not pay attention to its costumers and participates in retribution.   Lastly, for the years that I was involved with this bank, items would sit in the pending section of the account. Sometimes items would sit there for 10 days. But since Key Bank decided to close my account, items cleared within one day, even those items that were charged against the account by my son who is in another city. This shows that Key Bank purposefully leaves items in pending after which they reorder the debits to put the account in negative status.   I know that my complaining as I have could make me seem crazy and also that folks could argue that I do not manage my money well. But I represent many people who have no assets and who live pay check to pay check. This bank is notorious for these practices that I have highlighted over the last two months. I hope that at some point, Key Bank will be held accountable for their dishonesty and poor customer service. In the last year, I have paid the good part of XXXX $ in over draft fees. I do not have that money to give to Key Bank. XXXX the customer service rep said that she valued my patronage. Well, if that were true, then I would have had the overdraft fees refunded to me as I requested and Key Bank would not have tried to punish me by closing my account.   ",zhao393@purdue.edu,1

The initial investment was {$150000.00}. By XX/XX/XXXX it grew to {$160000.00}.

I had expressed to him that I wanted to leave this money to my grown children. He said you can  pass the wealth '' without worrying about them paying taxes after you die. The transaction had to be done before my XXXX birthday otherwise I would not qualify to get it. My birthday was two weeks away. I felt pressured but try to comply. He said XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX was best for me. I believe he used to work for that company before coming to Compass. It took one day to do the transfer. After two weeks, I received my portfolio on XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX. The financial advisor gave it to me and asked if I had any questions. I told him I had to take it home and read it before I could ask questions. The new insurance has a 13 day period to decline otherwise the insurance kicks in. I did n't have enough time to go over the insurance and come to talk to him because he gave me the insurance a few days before the expiration period. Now I find out the state allows a 30 day period to accept or decline.   This year, I get the form from XXXX indicating I owe the IRS {$4000.00} in taxes based on this transaction. How can I owe the IRS money I never spent. The check from XXXX went to my checking account. The financial advisor took that money to open the new investment. I never signed any check from XXXX. In addition, I found out that the surrender charge from XXXX was over {$9000.00}. Had I known this information, I never would have done this transaction. I feel violated.

The next day I received another email with a form which I assumed was for XXXX, but it was also for XXXX. Once again, I called the customer service number and spoke with a woman.

I asked her what the amount was for the new consolidated loan, and she told me it was {$320000.00}! I was shocked, as this amount was twice as much as I had borrowed. She placed me on hold and when she returned, she said that they had another customer with my exact same name and exact same account number with the amount she had quoted me earlier. She told me that my loans had NOT been consolidated. She claimed to have resolved the issue and everything would be fine from here on out. Naturally, I was skeptical. So I sent an email to a customer service rep that I had been dealing with asking to send me XXXX ACH enrollment forms ; XXXX for each of my loans. From there on out, I began dealing with a man by the name of XXXX XXXX. He sent me an email with ACH enrollment forms which I completed and returned to him along with XXXX voided checks.

However, I received another email from XXXX XXXX about a month later stating that he had sent me the wrong form and that I needed to fill out another form. Once again, this form was for only XXXX loan and not XXXX. The email was addressed to XXXX XXXX ( My name is XXXX XXXX ), so I assumed that he had sent it to the wrong person. I replied to the email asking him if he had indeed sent it to the wrong person and asked for reassurance that the money was being automatically withdrawn from my account each month. He replied to the email stating that it had not. By now I had been dealing with this mess for over 4 months. I needed to speak with him personally and I could n't reach him by phone.

On that day, they refused a wire transfer deposit, refused a deposit at a branch, refused to provide any access to the account citing the closure by Risk Management.   I spoke with various departments of the bank about the closure. Several people including the Debit Credit Card fraud and dispute department acknowledged the bank had made an error. They confirmed the account was not overdrawn at the time of the closure.   The mistake occurred because the bank has certain automated tellers which accept large cash deposits, however because these tellers do not exist system-wide, there is not a method for operations to check if a large cash deposit has been made. Instead, the system assumes all teller deposits are pending. I made a {$1200.00} cash deposit at a teller and my receipt and my available balance shows the cash is available immediately.

2841,"After my debit card and a book of checks were stolen, I called and had my card canceled and a freeze added to my checking account. A little while later I went to a branch of my bank and they began the process of switching me to a new checking account number. Because of the conversation and a few other past issues with the bank, I decided to close my checking account and find a new bank.  I visited the Wells Fargo website for information about closing accounts and was told it needed to have a zero balance in order to process. I transferred the remaining funds in the checking account to my Wells Fargo savings account and went to a different branch, XXXX closer to my office.  There, a very nice banker told me he could close my savings account ( the XXXX with the transferred checking funds ) but had to wait a day to close the checking account because of pending transactions. He showed me where my checkings account had a zero balance, with the XXXX pending transactions included. We closed savings and I called the next morning to the Wells Fargo customer service line to close checking ( because the website says that 's possible ).  Instead, I was told those XXXX pending items had n't cleared - even though all XXXX were conducted by noon the previous day and the bank 's policy is to post transactions made by XXXX on a business day by XXXX. XXXX of the transactions were with the bank, including removing a small amount of cash and moving some checking funds to my linked XXXX credit card.  I was told the process could be finished by XXXX meaning I could call after lunch and close the final account.  But I checked the account after lunch to confirm the pending items were posted so I could close the account and an overdraft charge was added to the checking account for transferring all the funds out to my savings.  I spoke with a customer service representative who said he could do nothing because the overdraft charge was justified, even though my account was zeroed out in order to close it the day before and nothing else posted.  I went to the branch that helped me the day before and the banker that helped me was the XXXX to assist me again. He called his supervisor over and told him my account was rightfully at {$0.00} the day before. The supervisor looked at my account and agreed it was n't right. He tried to remove the overdraft charge, but the systems were n't working and told me I would have to go to another branch the next day to make sure it was removed and my balance was back at {$0.00}.  Those XXXX pending transactions were all made well before the cutoff the day before, but the customer service representative said she ca n't close a XXXXbalance account with the pending accounts ( including the XXXX done with the bank ). But the transfer of checking funds to my savings account, which was done at XXXX., was posted - not pending, and I find that suspect.  Now I 'm having to go to the bank again - on a weekend - to see if they processed the overdraft refund and if my pending transactions are finally posted, a full day after they were supposed to be.  I have not done anything with my account as far as spending or transferring funds other than those transactions, yet by not posting them in a timely manner, I 'm being held hostage with this account and incurring fees that are not justified.  The bank has not followed it 's own policy for posting transactions to customer accounts, they are levying bogus charges and then their own staff members are admitting it 's not correct. I have been hung up on by a customer service supervisor today, I have more waiting and travel tomorrow to ensure they 've fixed another of their mistakes, and I am being told every time I contact them it 's either  not their problem '' or their systems are down again and I can not close my account with a {$0.00}.

2939,"To Whom it May Concern, I was charged {$12.00} for insufficient funds on a check that I tried to deposit to my account. Prior to writing the check, the checkwriter checked her account to make sure she had sufficient funds. After depositing the check, I received the notice that I was being charged.   I tried to call Customer Service to ask why it is Wells Fargo 's policy to charge its customers for something which is not within their control. A company which claims to  proactively protect our customers ' financial security through a risk focused culture '' should not impose fees upon its patrons which they have no control over. This alienates those risk-averse people who do everything they can to be prudent in their financial decisions and do their due diligence because it imposes upon them a risk they can not obviate.  I have been a Wells Fargo Customer for a decade. I hold checking and savings account. I have a safety deposit box. I have a credit card. And as a student in professional school, I planned to patronize the bank for years to come. My experience with the Customer Service phone team has made me question these plans.   Upset over this fee, I called Customer Service to request a refund. I asked my customer service representative how any customer could avoid these fees in the future. She had no answer for me. I asked her if that means I should just avoid using Wells Fargo financial services in the future, and she essentially agreed that this was the only way for me to minimize my risk.  A business that claims protect its customers ' financial security while imposing undue fees on them ( that a prudent customer could not possibly control ) is not conducive to customer retention or satisfaction. How could I possibly feel that my money is secure if I can not protect myself from arbitrary fees?   The worst part of the entire experience is that the supervisor who I spoke to pretended that she did not hear me and hung up as I was trying to explain the situation. Luckily, I recorded the whole ordeal.   What I would like to know is exactly how Wells Fargo would advise me to avoid such charges in the future? Is there some magical database I can access to ensure that a check that I receive will have sufficient funds in the future? Or should I stop using Wells Fargo services in general?

This finally happened last year when I was told that occasionally charges would still go through ( due to  systemic '' issues ), and if that were to happen, I should come into the branch to get any overdraft charges reversed. This happened once on XXXX, three times on XXXX, and twice on XXXX. I went into the bank to get these overdraft charges reversed and was told something new, that overdraft protection only applies to charges that are made from my debit/credit card and not to charges routed through the bank account like checks. Since the charges were made from my XXXX card, which routes through my bank account, my account was overdrawn. Additionally, after Wells Fargo initially approved the charges ( against what I had been told would happen ), they then cancelled the payment the following day. When I asked why the bank first approved the payment and then cancelled it, I was told by a rep that Wells Fargo  tries to be helpful '' by  giving me until the end of the day to cover the cost of the charge.

'' When I pressed on this issue, and asked why does n't this bank just not approve charges if there is no money in the account, I was told  That is just not Wells Fargo 's policy.

In XXXX, I just happened to glance at the monthly billing statement, and saw an available credit which stands at {$30000.00}. Having just took on some large home repair expenses, I contacted Bank of America on XXXX XXXX to ask how I could utilize the available credit, as there is no  card '' associate with this account. The representative stated I had XXXX options, utilize access checks, go into the branch and take a cash advance or she could transfer me to the balance transfer department to utilize that option. However, this account would be referred to a  Non Serviceable '' status during XXXX 2016. Asking what that meant, I was informed that the XXXX Option accounts would no longer be offered, this account could not be utilized in any way after that time, and would close when the balance is paid. No problem. The representative indicated that she would send me out access check immediately, which would take a few business days. No problem.

I asked them why are XXXX accounts open with different checking account numbers and they did n't know. So I had them close the other account. For the account I wanted activated it took almost a month to get that activated because they kept sending me the old account signature card information to sign ( this is to open the account ) and the account I wanted to be open they kept saying that they have n't received my fax or mail regarding the signature card to sign. I had a direct deposit in the account so I was n't able to access any of my money. It makes it worst when they do n't have any branches within XXXX miles of XXXX XXXX. The next issue was the debit card. I requested to have a debit card sent, but they ended up sending me a debit card for the closed account. So I had to wait another 14 days just to receive that. The other issue was the starter checks. I asked for starter checks and they sent me the checks.

Well that happen with a check I wrote and the representative told me they would not charge the account a overdraft fee if I deposit money by check. Well I deposited money by check and was still charged a fee. Citibank even created issues with my car rental company.

Now in XX/XX/XXXX : I made sure I had sufficient funds in my Credit Union account and wrote myself a check for {$9000.00} and deposited it into Bank of America on XX/XX/XXXX using the mobile app on Android.   On XX/XX/XXXX, I find that there is a Hold placed on my deposit at BofA and the hold will clear only on XXXX. Huh, are we back in the dark ages?   On XX/XX/XXXX morning, I go to my credit Union and I find that BofA has not yet presented the check to them to be cashed. On XXXX XXXX evening, I find that the funds have been withdrawn from my credit union account.

3058,"I wanted to bring to the CFPB the following instance where I think consumer protection needs to be applied. I bank with Bank of America. I utilize on-line banking for Bill Pay and for managing my finances. I have direct deposit and other features which I use on a regular basis. On the interface user platform website that consumers see when they log in to On-Line Bank is the listing of accounts. When you go into each account, you see a snapshot of your account, with summary, account balance, available history and then below that what is processing for that day and what has cleared. When you go to Bill-Pay Screen where customers can make automatic payments, there is outgoing payments box.   About two weeks ago, I instructed Bank of America to make payments to my children school, each totaling {$3100.00}. I, technically speaking, asked the bank to process and issue a check for me to be paid on XX/XX/XXXX. I also a few weeks ago also asked the bank to process a payment for XXXX XXXX for {$100.00}. Today, I checked my on-line banking account page and saw that my XXXX XXXX payment was  processing '' and my account was deducted by the {$100.00}. But the payments made by Bank of America to my children 's school for {$3100.00} each were not showing up as  processing. '' This is a considerable amount of funds that were essentially processed by the bank with a confirmation assigned by the bank for the transition. Yet, my on-line banking balance did not reflect anywhere this deducted amount as of XX/XX/XXXX.   When I inquired, the Bank of America customer service said that that they do n't on the bill pay side show on the summary account side processed checks that they were instructed to send as  processing '' nor to they show this deduction anywhere in the on-line bank balance account summary or processing transactions. The only way you would know that these pending transactions were to be posted on XX/XX/XXXX were to go into Bill Pay. Then manually figure out your balance to know that you were not going to overdrawn when ACH clears at XXXX.   I bring this to your attention because I believe that any bank online user interface should be consumer friendly. No where would I know on my account summary that XXXX checks each for {$3100.00} were going to be debited from my account on XX/XX/XXXX unless I remembered to check my bill pay page. The summary of my account page does not reflect these as  processing '' payment even though I instructed the bank to send out or process these payments. If I did not have adequate funds or overdraft protection, I might run the risk of over drawing my account without realizing it because my account summary as of XX/XX/XXXX did not show these XXXX pending debits. The bank would then be able to charge me {$35.00} overdrafts and return checks. A consumer would have no way of knowing accurately what there bank account balance is as of the date payments are being sent and processed by the Bnak Please advise and to who I might talk to about this very frustrating and worrisome feature. Bank 's make most of their money off these types of consumer fees but, in fact, so consumers are accurately informed any consumer interface should be clear, accurate and reflect any and all transactions that the bank has been asked to process on behalf of the consumer / customer. I have screen shots I have shared with CFPB about what happened today on XX/XX/XXXX regarding account summary, processing transactions and bill pay.   ",bbrumfi@purdue.edu,0

3070,"I got a notice about some unusual activity on an account that I set up for my younger brother to pay his expenses while in college, basically transferring all the money electronically to a different account through a program called XXXX. After confirming that it was n't initiated by my brother ( it was not ), I called and immediately asked for a hold to be placed. For this, I was charged {$30.00} which pushed the account into overdraft, but I was not worried, because I was assured the money would be returned in short order. Fast forward to 4 days, the transaction clears, to my incredulity, for which I was charged an additional overdraft fee. Furthermore, a number of transactions for very minimal accounts were in processing PRIOR to this transaction being posted and I was charged an overdraft fee for all of them. Finally, the bank decides to decline a transaction from paypal for {$9.00} and {$5.00}, respectively. I was charged a {$35.00} NSF fee for each transaction. As if this were not insulting enough, XXXX and the bank then proceeded to recharge, and return those transactions a stunning XXXX times, charging a {$35.00} fee on each occurrence. What should have been {$200.00} that remained in the account, taken out due to unusual activity that I immediately notified the bank to not process, instead resulted in a cascade effect in which not only is the {$200.00} gone, the account currently sits at a negative balance of {$610.00}, of which {$490.00} is solely due to XXXX and the bank attempting to collect the same {$9.00} and {$5.00} multiple times a day for multiple days, and then returning the payment and charging me, despite no permissions granted to do as much.

3071,"On XXXX/XXXX/16 I received an email alert letting me know that my checking account was overdrawn. The email was puzzling since I know that I had not purchased any big ticket items. I immediately went to the bank branch where I opened my account to see what happened. This is what was explained to me : My checking account had been charged a series of 'mini fees ' that had been collected through debit card transactions. I asked why would the bank allow the transactions to continue when there was no money in the account? There was a mediocre explanation that eventually led to a requested print-out, by me, of my account. The print out revealed that SunTrust had been charging fees to my account of XXXX for each and every transaction. On some days, my account was charged up to XXXX of these XXXX fees on the same day. I 've been with SunTrust for less than six months, and they continue to, or the employee who opened the account, continues to make glaring errors in relation to my account. How? First, the account was set up improperly. Second, the representative who opened the account did not explain all of my options to me. This experience leads me to believe that there is poor management at this branch location ( XXXX XXXX ) and that the manager, XXXX XXXX is doing a horrible job with both managing and properly training his employees.  On XXXX/XXXX/16 I left a message at the branch requesting that XXXX XXXX call me. On XXXX/XXXX/16 when I saw XXXX XXXX to check on my account status, he had not even looked into it and explained to me that he had been busy. On XXXX/XXXX/16, XXXX XXXX explained to me that again he had been busy. It was not until that day that he even begin addressing my account. To this day, he has not taken responsibility in the mismanagement of my account and instead is trying to cover up for his employee, XXXX XXXX, who opened my accounts. I believe that XXXX XXXX and XXXX XXXX are more interested in meeting their account quotas instead of the care and attention to the consumer.  When I first opened account XXXX XXXX made a serious error of placing all of my money into my savings account instead of my checking account, as I had requested. This resulted in gross errors that led had to be straightened out when I went to pay my bills ; Certain payments did not go through due to XXXX XXXX 's error. In that instance, I do not believe XXXX XXXX was counseled by his manager. Something is amiss in the training if XXXX XXXX is allowed to continue making these mistakes and his manager is content with making excuses for his employees instead of re-training his employees and making sure the consumer is okay. XXXX XXXX sent me an email claiming that he tried to call me on the XXXX, but I do not believe that to be true, as I received no phone call. I, once again, had to be the one following up with him concerning my account.  A total of approximately XXXX in fees were charged to my checking account ; fees that are both exorbitant and ludicrous seeing the nature of the fees. SunTrust was allowing card transactions to go through whether or not there was any money in the account. I feel that this was an instant payday predatory practice by the bank as they are aware that my paychecks are direct deposited every two weeks like clockwork. I believe that I was seen as an easy target and money could be made from my account due to my direct deposit. I will reiterate that these options were not explained to me thoroughly when I opened my account. My account was set up improperly. It is for this reason that I am requesting a full refund of all of my fees. SunTrust has violated my trust and is exploiting the consumer.  My account was being charged for debit card transactions of XXXX, XXXX, XXXX, XXXX, XXXX, XXXX, XXXX, XXXX, XXXX, XXXX, etc. SunTrust is taking advantage of consumers.   ",wang1768@purdue.edu,1

It promised a bonus of {$150.00} for opening a new account, as it read  It 's never been so easy to earn {$150.00} '' and on the bottom it read  For a limited time, we want to offer you a {$150.00} gift card just for signing up ''. Inside the bank, I was explained that I 'd have to have a special account that could accept credit card payments. I told the rep, that I do n't really need to process credit cards, but was persuaded anyways to open an account. I was assured of getting my bonus after just XXXX credit card transaction. I received a swiping device for credit cards for my smart phone soon after. I processed XXXX card for {$1000.00} and when I got the statement, I was shocked to see a charge of over {$80.00} as a processing fee. I was sure it was a mistake, and called the bank so they could correct it. They denied that it was a high fee, stating that it was a competitive fee for processing credit cards. That rate sounded very high to me, so I asked them to close my account. I was told :  Sir, if you close your account now, you 'll be charged an early termination fee of {$500.00}. If you want to avoid this penalty fee, you 'd need to wait for 1 year for the contract to end, before you can close your account. However, we 'll continue charging you our  standard '' monthly fees for that time ( 1 year ), and then we 'll refund you retroactively for that year.

On the day I signed up, I was in the bank for about XXXX7 minutes and was told to sign and initial in a few places, and the rep did n't give me any time to look over the documents saying,  It 's just the standard stuff all banks ask you to sign ''. In any case, I did n't put up a fight, deciding just to wait out the year to avoid the {$500.00} fee. I waited patiently for 1 year, not paying too much attention to the exhurbant fees I was being charged, knowing I 'd be getting them refunded soon. However, when the year was up, I called the bank to close my account, and to my surprise I was told  Sir, your contract is for 3 years, and if you close now, you 'll be subjected to the {$500.00} early termination fee. '' I could n't believe my ears. I tried to explain that I was told it would only be 1 year, but the other party did n't want to hear of it.

I checked my account to find that someone had withdrawn money from my account the previous day from a XXXX atm machine in XXXX XXXX Maryland. I was admittedly alarmed because I have been a victim of identity theft before and I was upset that this has happened to me again. I filed a police report in hopes of having the atm footage pulled to see how and who could have done this, while my card was still in my possession. I have received a new card in the mail however, my funds were not given back to me. I called the bank to follow up on my claim and I was told that the case was closed because since the incident happened in my geographical area no fraud had taken place. I am now in disbelief!!! The person I spoke with also went on to tell me that It had to be a friend or a family member that I gave the card and information to because there was no counterfeit card used. At this point I XXXX feel so betrayed by the very people I trust to protect my money. I was told there was nothing else the bank could do for me. I asked had they obtained that camera footage, he stated to me he would not have that information and even if they did,  I '' would have to identify the person in order for the bank to do anything. WHAT????? I have called XXXX XXXX, the police department in my area, the police department in the area where the fraud took place and NO ONE can steer me in the right direction. XXXX XXXX states that bank of America should protect my money and that they can request the camera footage directly from them, the police department in my area states this has to be handled by the police department in the area of the fraud, that police department states that my district has to send over the information to them. My district now states they have no way of sending over the information. Meanwhile, someone is out here who has stolen my money and has basically gotten away with it. That account was set up as child support for my XXXX year old daughter through the state of Maryland, I am a hard working woman that provides for my family but to have someone take money from me and I have no support is very disheartening as a consumer. I need to know who can help me with fighting this claim, I can not afford to just let this go and I did absolutely nothing wrong. I have requested for the camera footage to be pulled and I ca n't even get that done. Someone has stolen from me and I am the one being treated as the criminal. I will do whatever I have to do to prove I have been victimized. The police officer told me this has been happening alot and the bank made me feel like they have never heard of such a thing. I would never allow someone to use my atm card or have access to my personal identification number that't why I have so many alerts and passwords on my accounts to try and prevent this from happening. I have a police report number, the date the transaction took place and the amount that was taken from me. Also the bank told me since the PIN number was entered the first time correctly, I must have given it to someone!!! I have never felt so disrespected in my life.

3148,For several months now i been having trouble trying to balance my checking account with JP Morgan Chase. Since every time a transaction happen they blame the merchant for when they process the bank and I keep getting charge over draft fee 's. When for example the most recent transaction happen XXXX/XXXX/2016 ; I have over XXXX worth of fee 's after I just finish getting my deposit from my employer and my account was on the dot. I call to complaint about a transaction and i had a balance of {$2.00} after a {$300.00} payment I disagree but got nothing but an email next day I see all this transaction that happen the week before post in a different order and dates and make me owe now Chase again overdraft fee 's. So why they keep doing this when the transaction happen they take out your balance but they posted later differently and make the account be overdraft. I think this a dishonest way of doing business and making this inconvenient for the consumer that really needs a checking account now and days and ca n't talk to their representatives or manager because they just do n't care we have to pay. Now my account is {$200.00} over draft after that conveniently they cover my transactions when to begin with the money was there and if XXXX item was not available then I understand the overdraft fee but not for XXXX items that originally the money was there and if not they would n't decline my transaction this is deceiving and incorrect they need to have a better way of handling this.

3213,"XXXX : WHY BANKS SHOULD NOT OWN BROKERAGE SERVICES OR RECOMMEND ANY STOCK / BANK STOCK / WRITTEN DISCLOSURES REQUIREDDear XXXX XXXX XXXX, At the start of the XX/XX/2008 financial crises I was recommended to a Financial Adviser at BB  T, XXXX XXXX.

We had numerous conversations about  Capital Preservation '' and my numerous request not to be on BB  T 's solicitations financial services products and numerous conversations that my cell phone number not to utilized by BB  T 's solicitations for financial services. When BB  T offered an 8 % preferred stock offering, XXXX XXXX called and set up an IRA securities account for me. A couple of years later to conform to Dodd-Frank rules, I learned years later, I received a unsolicited call from XXXX XXXX stock associate, XXXX XXXX, XXXX strongly selling BB  T  replacement '' preferred stock a new preferred with no disclosures regarding the risk of loss, no disclosure statements, promoting his CFP ( Certified Financial Professional ) ethics, my best alternative, etc. Substantial losses occurred as BB  T customers looked for the safety of FDIC deposits only to be moved over to unscrupulous BB  T products and employees for the benefit of BB  T Dodd Frank requirements. Later other BB  T employees stated  they would not have touched selling the BBT preferred, especially after not being able to recommend the BBT common stock. '' I think XXXX XXXX, XXXX should had disclosed he was not acting in my best interest ( as required by the CFP ethics ) and even though XXXX XXXX was 100 % of the time utilizing the trusting XXXX logo, he chooses when he is utilizing the XXXX ethics. Financial brokers should be required to provide disclosure material by email or other written form, make there financial recommendations and disclosures in writing, and have executed forms of disclosure.

I attempted on numerous occasions to deal strictly with another broker that I had know from XXXX and XXXX XXXX and his manager, XXXX XXXX prevented my request, another CFP violation.   Bottom Line : It appears that the banks draw in deposits with FDIC assurance and build trust with a financial adviser ; at the same time strongly push and make financial incentives for the financial adviser to transfer deposits over to the brokerage side of the bank while building trust with logos like XXXX and later claim the XXXX trust and ethics are applicable.  Request that the CFPB make rules to stop predatory stock sales, require written disclosure and upfront cost disclosure and risk, be fair and transparent, hold the financial institution responsible for the employees services and / or dishonesty.

3224,"A couple of months ago I received a letter from USAA indicating that I owed some money and my account was past due. I called them to indicate that there has been an identity theft since I never opened the card nor was in possession of the card. Over the past few months I have called them several times to address the issue. Every time, it seems as though they are doing something about it but they arent and I find that they are simply having the collection agents harass me about the money. There is no mention of what they have done to investigate the identity theft and what their conclusion was. When I call identity theft department at USAA, they hear me out for a few minutes and either put down the phone or connect me back to collections.  It is extremely unprofessional and I have not seen this with any of the credit agencies or banks that I have dealt with.  At a minimum, i would have expected them to take note of the details, investigate it and get back to me on why they think that I was the one to open the account or atleast let me know the outcome of their investigation. I think there has been a presumption on their part to conclude without adequate investigation that I was the one to open the card. USAA I am told is typically open only to people either in the military or relatives of military. I have NO connection to the military and it seems like they did n't even bother to check this fact before issuing the card to whoever was impersonating me.  I think the burden of proof should be on them to show me the documents to conclude that I opened the account. I even told them that I have a filed a police report and was willing to provide them with the report number. They did n't bother with it since they have pre-concluded without any investigation. I was told that the domain of the email address which was used to open the account was  XXXX ''. If they use a little common sense, that would be the first indication that it is a fraudulent account or atleast give me a chance to hear me out and take my complaint seriously.  It has been extremely frustrating since they seem extremely unprofessional in the way they are going about this issue. I have been thrown around from one department to another and there is no transparency on what is going on. When I first reported it, they seemed to take down all the details but a few weeks later, they indicated no record of it and asked me to repeat the story again. I did and someone pretended to file a report and gave me a case number XXXX with the promise of some outcome in 5-7 business days. When I called them after a week with the case number, they simply were trying to transfer me back to collections.  I feel I have no recourse as a consumer as I have no way of knowing what they are investigating and what they are concluding. I seem to be at their whim and they are holding me to ransom for their negligence in not verifying some basic credentials such as signature and proof of military. I think they need to be held liable for their negligence.   ",jdenhar@purdue.edu,1

3270,"I 'm an account holder with Wells Fargo. In XXXX, I wrote out a check for {$5200.00}. After receiving the check the individual that the check was written out to was unsuccessful in cashing it and the check bounced, after which that individual acquired {$12.00} in fees. After it was brought to my attention, I was perplexed as to why the check would bounce, since I specifically inquired about my balance that same week while I was depositing my funds. After investigating the issue and spending a substantial amount of my time at the bank, I was informed that the reason why my check bounced was  inconsistencies with my signature. '' Although, I appreciate the efforts of Wells Fargo to protect their clients from fraudulent activities, I am extremely upset that Wells Fargo would not make any attempts to contact me before canceling my OWN check and causing me so much stress and time on resolving this issue. I did not receive any notification or messages informing me of the issue and the check was simply canceled and I almost ended up losing extremely valuable transaction and prior deposits that were associated with that transaction! I was also informed that I may be charged additional fees ( {$35.00} XXXX in regards to this transaction. I am perplexed on how I ca n't assign my own funds and Wells Fargo can simply just cancel a transaction because  it seemed like it was n't my signature '' and for Wells Fargo not make a reasonable attempt in contacting me. The account was opened 10 years ago and there might be minor changes in signatures for different reasons like older age. I 'm just wondering why Wells Fargo did n't bounce all of my other checks that were substantially smaller in their amount value, since I write out a lot of them every month. My signatures vary and are not identical every time. It seems that it only benefits Wells Fargo. I had to repay the {$12.00} to the individual for acquiring the fees, additionally had to pay {$10.00} for the cashiers check because I could n't use my OWN check. I do n't see the purpuse of having checks if i ca n't use them. Also, I was informed that for the issue to be resolved I had to write a letter explaining the situation, which I did. It was still not good enough and I was continuously transferred from one department to the next. Wells Fargo representative informed me that they would reimburse me, but they could n't since the receiving party was not a Wells Fargo customer. Does n't make sense to me! They are essentially admitting their fault but ca n't resolve the issue. Every time I will have to write a check for a large amount, I have to notify them?!? It is so frustrating to feel like you have done everything right on your part and you still ca n't get a resolution.  I would like for the issue to be resolved and all of the fees associated with this transaction reimbursed or stopped, since I do n't feel that I should be held accountable for Wells Fargo 's inadequate assumptions about my own signature. Additionally this account is a joint account and both names on the account have the same initials, hence the confusion might of emerged from there. In any case, I would like to get refunded the {$12.00} that I had to repay, in addition address any further fees/penalties on my account.   ",mspanier@purdue.edu,0

3370,"I have been experiencing problems with Wells Fargo Bank N.A .  First problem : Wells Fargo Allowed a change to my bank account personal information at the request of an identity thief after I had submitted a 7 year extended fraud alert on my credit profile with the credit reporting bureaus. Wells Fargo should have contacted me personally with the contact information on my bank account profile in their computer before they changed my personal information. Wells Fargo changed my drivers license number and state of issuance, my country of origin, and my home address to those of the identity thief. I have proof of this because a Wells Fargo Banker at a local branch office in my hometown showed me on the banks computer that my information had been altered. He also gave me a printed copy of the changes that had been made. I closed the account since Wells Fargo did n't keep my bank account safe.  The second problem I have had with Wells Fargo is that they have denied me access to online access to the Wells Fargo credit card I have with them. Wells Fargo sent me a letter saying they restricted my online access due to my identity theft issues. I have tried to contact them many times by phone to resolve the problem but I have waited up to 30 minutes on hold with their fraud department and often get disconnected.  The third problem I have had with Wells Fargo is with their credit card processing service called XXXX. I have a business and needed to have a mobile credit card terminal to be able to accept my customers credit card payments so I purchased a mobile credit card swiper from XXXX and then signed up for a merchant account with XXXX.

I was sent an email saying I had been denied service due to credit report information from XXXX. I checked my XXXX credit report and found no negative information on it. I believe Wells Fargo is denying me the XXXX service simply because I have a 7 year extended fraud alert on my credit report.

In XX/XX/XXXX I learned that my account had been overdraft into a little over {$200.00} but since I did n't sign up for overdraft protection I figured that whatever the charge was ( because I had n't used my debit card any that month so it did n't come from me ) that it would be revered  thought nothing else of the matter. I received a letter about the issue  called but a recording came on about some type of trip/vacation giveaway/promotion  then something about high call volume  then the phone would disconnect but again I was thinking that the issue would be reversed because I is n't have the overdraft protection. In XXXX I received the same letter but now the overdraft totaled a little more than {$200.00}  I was thinking how is this possible I have n't used my card since XX/XX/XXXX! So I called my bank  was told that they had reversed the credit of the unauthorized charge! My question was why and why had n't I been informed that this was the result of the investigation? The lady told me that she did not have that information but she would get her manager to help me with that issue. The manager got on the phone and asked how could she help and I asked why was the charge reversed and why had n't I been notified of that action. She told me that the company said that the book return was late so the charge was reversed, now I 'm perplexed. I dropped the book off at the XXXX location weeks prior to the due date so what XXXX did after I dropped it off had nothing to do with me plus it was in the month of XXXX, XXXX holidays, busy month, etc how can I be faulted for that and plus they still have the book in question that apparently you just informed me that I 've paid for! Why would you reverse a charge to a company that I returned unaltered, non-damaged goods back to? I was then told that I would have to contact that company, wow! So I asked for and was given the number to ecampus.com books, was told someone would return my call to help me with the issue but after XXXX days I had n't heard anything so I reported them to the BBB at the end of XXXX and to date the BBB has not gotten a response from this company although they have until XXXX. It 's a little disturbing to learn that a bank that 's suppose to secure your money can complete a unauthorized charge investigation be told something to contradict their consumers claim  they just release your funds just like that without warning, notice or follow up, nothing given to you so that you can argue or provide proof to that dispute. When I disputed the charge I told the bank CS agent when I mailed the book  that maybe the company has n't received it yet because of the holidays but that I dropped the book to XXXX almost two weeks before the book was due on the XXXX of XXXX  I know this because they sent a reminder that the book was coming due and then another XXXX stating if I needed more time, etc which I did n't because I had already shipped it. So even knowing this ( I know they put notes on cases ) the bank still chose to reverse the credit and did so without warning or notice about the investigation  their choice to reverse a {$140.00} charge based off a company saying  the book was late '' not that they did n't receive the book ( which would have been opposite to my claim of me returning the book ) but it was late! I paid for a book that I do not have because my bank thought it best to reverse a charge that was unauthorized simply because the book company said it was late all without notice or investigation follow up choice  that 's highly unacceptable in my eyes.

All while this is going on, I supposed the  back office '' of Chase reviewed my account and decided that they no longer would be doing business with me, and chose to close the account. I never received notice of this decision. When I received my new card in the mail, it did n't work and I called in to customer service and was informed of my account being closed. I was never given the reason why, but I told the representative that this would n't work because I had direct deposit coming from my employer that was too late to change. Either way, the closure was n't scheduled for another XXXX business days ( the XXXX business day was today ) so my direct deposit went through just fine. On XXXX XXXX, I went to a Chase branch to withdraw my remaining funds before my account closed and I found out that the Loss Prevention Department put a restriction on my account until the claim disputes I filed were finalized, I would not have access to over {$400.00} dollars until then.

3562,"This is a formal complaint against eBay and its associated financial service PayPal for not acting in a fair and reasonable fashion according to the accepted definition of arbitration according to XXXX fiduciary law. On XXXX XXXX, {$160.00} was deducted from my PayPal account without warning or explanation. In  Non-receipt - Claim - # XXXX '', the buyer was awarded a full refund for his claim that Transaction # XXXX was not completed due to the item in question not being received. Upon learning of this issue, I promptly replied by responded to both PayPal and the buyer directly through eBay 's messaging service. I also provide physical proof of the product 's shipment via USPS and the Customs Barcode Number XXXX.   The buyer himself had the option to alert me as the shipper that he had not received the item within a reasonable time frame before elevating his concerns to a PayPal claim. That is not a constructive or courteous way to do business particularly with sellers in the eBay marketplace in good standing with as high a rating as I have. Further to that, I negotiated a resolution to the problem directly with the buyer that was satisfactory to him albeit still a financial loss to me. I uploaded the text of that offer to the PayPal claim folder and discussed it over the phone with a PayPal customer service rep who approved of it and welcomed my cooperation.   My offer was to replace the item rather than reimburse the buyer because the rarity of the time made replacement a more attractive and valuable option to him. In response, the buyer agreed to  give up XXXX his ) claim ''. I followed by explaining that it would take me a couple of days before sending the poster in question because I was low on funds in my PayPal account. On XXXX XXXX he accepted my offer and agreed with my evaluation of the mishap. However, having not honored his own offer to cancel the claim, before I could ship the replacement item either he, PayPal or XXXX deducted the full amount from my PayPal account which not only disallowed me the ability to purchase shipping, but prevented my ability to ship to any of my eBay customers as it put my account in a negative balance.   As these emails document, the buyer understood and agreed on XXXX XXXX that it would take me  a couple of days '' to send the item. However, not did he not fulfill his obligation to cancel the claim, in those two days after the claim was decided in his favor and my money was gone. Not only is that an egregious and callous act on the part of both the buyer and PayPal, but there is no shipping service that would have been able to deliver the package according to our agreement before the case was decided.   I was only informed by PayPal with a pair of automatically generated emails that offered me no ability, much less professional courtesy, to respond. When I spoke to PayPal 's customer service, I was met only with didactic, patronizing rhetoric and no constructive explanation or remedy.   I do n't need to remind you of what is now public knowledge and that which is increasingly deteriorating your companies credibility and reputation.

3570,"To whom it May Concern, I, XXXX XXXX, hereby declare that I have been a loyal customer of bank of America since 1998. I have changed accounts four times for security reasons, but I never left my bank. It has been about ten months or so since that the overdraft fees that bank of America charges have become outrageous. Bank of America reorders debit card transactions/e-bill payments and withdraws in various ways ( usually placing the higher amounts first that will leave customers with negative balances XXXX, therefore ; the average client will be left with more than a few costly overdraft fees. Every time I have called to complain about how my available balance changes from day to day, the supervisors and customer representatives tell me that the automatic system rearrange transactions in different ways. Sometimes the automatic system will process larger transactions first and others the system will not process transactions correctly over the weekend. Consequently, on Monday morning the average costumer will be surprised with a bunch of overdraft fees. I have asked supervisors and customer reps to amend the mistakes that the automatic service makes. Some managers will waive a few charges. Others, like the last supervisor I spoke with will tell me that if I balance my account using my phone or a computer, I am destined to pay overdraft fees every week. If that is the truth, why does bank of America promotes mobile applications, online banking usage and online statements? Then, to make it more ridiculous the supervisor told me that if I kept doing my balance using paper and pencil and comparing it with my online balance, I was also destined to be charged hundreds of dollars in overdraft fees. Supervisors keep talking about the automatic service and blaming it for all overdraft fees like the automatic service is an electronic device that ca n't be handled by human beings ( it has its own mind ). My sister who was a loyal customer for XXXX years of Bank of America left the bank because of the same reason : Bank of America is rearranging deposits and withdraws anyway they want, so they can make millions charging overdraft fees. Something has to be done to stop Bank of America for charging overdraft fees in order to increase costs to average consumers for their benefit.   ",hu417@purdue.edu,0

I went inside the banking center and asked the teller if there was an atm at this location and he confirmed there was one around the side. However the teller informed me that he could complete the transaction inside and i asked is it the same fees as the atm outside and he stated that they were. The teller then asked the associate next to him how to complete the transaction and the teller informed him to do a cash advance. I then asked are you sure the fees are the same as using the atm, the atm only charges me {$3.00} from my other bank and wells fargo charges {$2.00} because its a non wells fargo account. The teller reassured me they were the same. After the transaction was complete there was a {$17.00} charge on my account because the teller ran it as a cash advance. I went to the manager, the manager had the personal banker call my bank and my bank informed us theres nothing they can do. Its wells fargos fault for running it as a cash advance. I ended up being late back to work, the manager said he was going to call me and i have yet to be called. I was lied to, they wrongfully did a transaction that i did not authorize, and wells fargo stole {$17.00} from me. I asked the manager to either reverse the charge or reimburse me to fix the situation.   ",wang1768@purdue.edu,1

3657,This complaint is in regards to a joint checking account with Santander Bank ; my son  I opened the account approximately 10 years ago. My son XXXX is the primary user of the account. Over the 10 years he has never bounced a check. XX/XX/2015 he made a mistake and the account became over-drafted ( he did n't realize ) a few days later he received an automated deposit in which made the account positive again. He then paid his rent and other bills with out knowing he had been charged several over draft fees. This resulted in the account again becoming over drafted. Apparently he was allowed to continue to use his ATM debit account due to the fact the account has over-draft protection. The account went several days into over draft before he realized the entire situation. Once I called the bank  spoke with the branch manager they had charged the account {$40.00} per day with a total of {$750.00}. The manager after checking with her regional supervisor agreed to refund {$100.00}. My complaint is as follows : myself nor my son where given written or verbal notice of the over draft of the account or fees being charged.  1 ) The fees are excessive in nature!  2 ) The overdraft protection should n't allow the consumer continue to engage in charges to the account when over-drafted after a certain amount of usage.  3 ) The bank has misused overdraft protection allowing the bank to charge the consumer absorbent fees without notice.  4 ) The fees charged to the account and action taken by the bank is egregious towards consumers.   ,quinn35@purdue.edu,0

For instance - a customer has {$100.00} in their account. XXXX items are presented for payment. XXXX items for {$90.00}, XXXX items for {$15.00} and XXXX item for {$20.00}.

I asked that USAA please RETURN the {$9500.00} they had TAKEN from my checking account and applied to the loan. USAA representatives could not ( or would not ) reverse the charge.  2. I then requested my CD funds be released and deposited into my checking account as to cover the overdrawn funds. USAA representatives could not ( or would not ) provide me access to my CD account or money in the account, although the CD had matured that day.   Moreover, USAA representatives agreed that my account was overdrawn in error and that the loan balance should have been paid with monies from the CD against which the loan was secured, and they were BAFFLED as to why I could not access my CD or withdraw the funds, but they had no suggestions or apparent means of resolve. I was a told that the money withdrawn from my checking account was a  systems '' issue and irreversible. I was also told not to  worry '' as the  system '' would return the overdrawn funds to my checking account by XXXX XXXX XXXX, minimizing the possibility of more overdrafts.   RESULTS:1. A negative checking account balance that could not be reversed by USAA nor covered by me, because USAA would not give back the {$10000.00} I had invested 36 months prior with the good faith understanding that I could withdraw the $ XXXX and accrued interest on the CDmaturity date of XXXX XXXX, 2015.  2. A secure loan DUE but NOT PAID because USAA had overdrawn my checking account and blocked my attempts to withdraw the CD funds that would have covered the overdraft and paid the loan amount due.  3. NON PAYMENT of four checks posted to my checking account that subsequently bounced, due to the overdraft CAUSED by USAA, and the REFUSAL on the part of USAA reps to reverse the overdraft that USAA made in error or give me access to the CD funds that were due to me that day. I will provide documentation with exact amounts and dates, if needed.   ",ddye@purdue.edu,0

I find it odd and disturbing that they sent me an immediate alert that my payment transfer from my Citizens Bank checking account to their Citizens Bank credit card failed to go through, yet no alert indicating I would not be charged a late fee and would not be responsible for interest charges. They were aware that my payment failed to process due to a technology issue at their end ; therefore they should have also been aware the late payment would result in erroneous interest charges and fees at my end, yet they failed to communicate this to me. I had to make a phone call to Citizens and was kept on the phone for XXXX minutes waiting for this issue to be resolved. It was finally resolved, but only because I caught the error.

I am not even worried. I happened to go to the branch the other day, and check on the status of the card. I was told that I had to provide further information, namely, ( Apt number ), which I then did. Next, the banker told me that your card will be mailed out to you soon. So far, no stress and everything is cool. I walk out, and next day, which is literally this day ( Friday ) I try to buy some food using my debit card, but could n't. Debit Card was never accepted by all machines. Things started to get weird! I then tried to get some cash via an ATM, however, it kept declining the transactions. I then went straight to the closest bank branch, which is at the University XXXX. I was trying to explain what 's going on, and understand the problem, yet bankers -including the manager- were being too unhelpful.

I showed them my University ID, as well as an international valid driving license. They did n't however bother to check onto my account, and yet insisted to see my passport, which I obviously did n't have at that point, nor was I able to go get either. I was frustrated because I was not even able to afford for a taxi to take me back home, so that I can get my passport and fix the issue. I never held cash on me. I felt condescended.

After verifying of my identity, they told me that my debit card has been deactivated. And the reason is because another card will have been mailed to you. My answer was Seriously?? It just does n't make no sense to deactivate all my working debit cards ( XXXX ) because you are sending me another one for another checking that has not even been received, and without any temporary cards! Simply, I have been blocked out of my accounts. I was no longer able to get any money out of my money just because of that! I could n't use the card, and I could n't do anything else.

The thief did try to buy things and succeeded at spending about {$50.00} on food but was declined from spending over {$400.00} at Target. When I called Chase, I informed them that my wallet had been stolen. I got all my credit and debit cards canceled and re-issued, however Chase did not put a fraud alert on my accounts. Then, 10 days later, someone went into a Chase branch in XXXX, IL and impersonated me using my license, forged my signature and withdrew almost all the money from my checking and savings accounts. I realized this two days later and went to a Chase branch in person to close all of my accounts. When I went to my local Chase branch, the banker I was working with actually admitted that it was negligent for them to have not put any fraud warning on my accounts when I told them that my wallet had been stolen. He also said it was very unusual for someone to actually walk into a bank and impersonate someone else and withdraw money. He helped me file claims and told me it would take 10 business days for me to be refunded. The Chase banker told me that Chase will do their own investigation to figure out how and why this teller allowed someone who was n't me to withdraw my money but also told me that I was n't allowed to know anything about the investigation - I would not be told any results. He told me they 'd have to  investigate '' to make sure that I was n't scamming them - pretending that my money was gone when in fact I had withdrawn it myself. I filed police reports and everything as well. Well, it has now been 13 business days and I have not been refunded. I just contacted Chase Claims department and without an apology they told me  it '' just was n't done yet, meaning the  investigation '' to make sure that I was n't making all this up. The woman on the phone acknowledged that it had been over their stated 10-day turnaround but offered me nothing else than a  you 'll have to call back in 2-3 days. They 're short-staffed over there. '' I was already really angry at Chase for a ) not putting a fraud alert on my account when they knew my wallet had been stolen and b ) allowing some teller to distribute my money to a criminal who had impersonated me and now I 'm utterly disgusted with them for their lack of concern, negligence and slowness in resolving what was a HUGE mistake on their part. And I do n't even know IF they will be reimbursing me - they may come back and say that they think I 'm scamming them. On top of all of this, I set up security questions to be asked when I call over the phone. I just called them today and was not asked any of the security questions - just my name and address. And guess what? The person who stole my wallet has all of that information and could have easily pretended to be me. Chase needs to implement some better security procedures, such as asking a security question when you go to withdraw large amounts of money, and actually implementing the security questions when they say they will. I do not feel safe banking with them now, nor do I have any confidence in them. If this does not get resolved in a timely manner I will be moving banks.   ",zhu316@purdue.edu,1

I had pre-arranged thismeeting with XXXX XXXX XXXX a banker that I had known since I first started doing businessthere ). I explained to her that I would need a bill of sale notarized ( which she said she could do ) and told her about the mobile home and the realtor 's contract and since I had recently opened an account specifically to deposit money for this purchase, I feltthat I would be safe finalizing the purchase there. I was so wrong about that. I would findout. The Realtor and Seller were there before I got there. The process of getting the checkfrom the account was endless. They ( XXXX XXXX and XXXX men I did not know from thebank ) took well over an hour to present a check for {$15000.00} drawn from my account unlike any check I had ever seen before. The XXXX male bankers signed it, I did not. It was made out to the seller with no acknowledgement about the mobile home, my name was printed in the memo section. The check made me uncomfortable but, It had taken so long for them to produce the check that my questions about it were given short shrift. To continue, first, a few hours later I found out I was not given a clear Title. The Seller and Realtor had given me a Title that still listed the Sellers dead husband on it. That was taken care of but, a few hours later I discovered that there was No working air conditioning. I was told it just did not work very well and the weather was still cool until I bought it and so I offered less money for it. There had been a slight odor that seemed to come and go but, it now reeked horribly in the heat of the mobile home. The next morning I called customer service at TCF Bank and said I had to stop payment on the check if at all possible Immediately! I was told to go to the branch because yes, the check had not cleared and I could Absolutely Stop Payment. I raced to the bank only to be told by XXXX XXXX that NO I could not stop payment. She refused to stop payment no matter what I told her about the condition of the mobile home, the awful smell smell it had etc.  Instead she produced a letter stating if I stopped payment I would be guilty of perjury. This letter was from their XXXX XXXX XXXX, ready and waiting when I got there. XXXX XXXX was not alerted by me that I was coming. I called an attorney out of the phone book who told me I should certainly be able to stop payment ( it was my money ) and It was within a couple of days of the purchase etc. etc. XXXX was rude, threatening and nasty. I told her she was responsible for my losing {$15000.00}. She did not care. Customer service said she should have stopped payment and then told me I now would have to wait 90 days for any further action to be taken. I closed my savings account and left. I have since learned therewere numerous wrongs on the contract and that would have been ample reason to stop payment. I believe now that they would not do it because of the way they cut the check.

I did call, and the representative assured me they would look into the charge. No change was made on the account and the charge still remained. No messages from Wells Fargo were posted to the account message center and no other communication was sent to me via email or letter.  On XXXX/XXXX/2015 I called Wells Fargo to ask for the status. After being cut off three times navigating the bank 's phone system, I spoke to a representative who told me the charge would remain because I had not disputed it within 24 hours. I said I had disputed it within 24 hours of noticing the charge, but she insisted I only had 24 hours from the time the charge was posted to the account. When I asked why they had not notified me, she said a letter had recently been sent. I also spoke with her supervisor who gave me the same response ; although both indicated they were sorry. I asked why the person who took my original call had indicated the charge would be corrected if found to be incorrect, and I was told that person had  been mistaken. '' I asked to speak with the supervisor 's supervisor and was told I would receive a call back. I did not receive that call. This process took more than an hour.  Some important points : 1 ) I informed Wells Fargo within minutes after I became aware of the charge. 2 ) This is a business account where I have money, but I often go some time without making a withdrawal. 3 ) I was sent a debit card for this account but I 'm quite sure I never intentionally activated it and I know for sure I have never used it ( the card was shredded shortly after receiving it ). No credit card or line of credit is associated with this account. 4 ) The charge I disputed is the only charge on that account for XX/XX/XXXX ( there were also no charges in XX/XX/XXXX ). I have since moved most money from that account out of concern that fraudulent activity might resume. XXXX ) I do n't know the source of the charge. Wells Fargo has not told me if they consider the charge to be a debit-card charge, a credit-card charge, or some other type of transfer ( the first XXXX should not be possible ). I presume it 's not a check since no image is posted online. 6 ) Lacking information from Wells Fargo, I do n't know how to contact the source of the charge -- I ca n't find them online from the information provided -- and I do n't know whether this is simply a mistake or fraudulent activity. 7 ) Wells Fargo indicated that they made no attempt to ascertain whether or not the charge was fraudulent or an error. Their investigation was limited to whether or not I had noticed the charge in time. 8 ) The idea that I have to monitor my account every day and notify the bank of any unauthorized activity within 24 hours is outrageous, especially on an account that has not had authorized transactions for XX/XX/XXXX and XX/XX/XXXX ( with the exception of a deposit and transfers made because of this potentially fraudulent activity ). 9 ) I checked the account on XX/XX/XXXX to see if a deposit made on XX/XX/XXXX had been posted. Even though I 've been making deposits for more than 20 years from the same highly reputable source, Wells Fargo often arbitrarily puts holds on deposits. So I do check those. 10 ) I notified Wells Fargo of the unauthorized charged before receiving a statement for the month. I do review the statement monthly and it 's my expectation that is the time to look for concerns with Wells Fargo 's management of the account and that any clock that starts on notification should start with the statement or a communication from Wells Fargo.

No response from anyone at Coastal the following week, so I begin researching consumer rights and contact a lawyer.  XXXX XXXX XXXX/XXXX/15 : Coastal tells me that the application to reinstate has been entered and we are waiting back on the credit XXXX PM XXXX/XXXX/15 : I respond saying that I have spoken with a lawyer and the FDIC , CFPB in regards to this situationXXXX PM XXXX/XXXX/15 : Coastal Branch manager responds saying give him a call and let 's talk through thisXX/XX/2015 : Branch manager calls and says that I still have a judgment on my account per the credit report they recently pulled ; I find it unbelievable that it continues to be on there, but tell him I 'll make some calls and call him back. I immediately call Equifax to confirm this information. There is no judgment on my report and the last time I had a hard credit inquiry was on XXXX -- when Coastal originally pulled, starting this mess. So, someone is not telling me the truth here. I send branch manager an email with a scanned copy of the vacated judgment and XXXX ( XXXX ) separate bureau FICO credit reports that I pulled recently, showing there is NO judgment on my records. I ask him to send me a copy of the credit report he is looking at and he says he can not send this to me. He also states that he inquired on the date the report was pulled and will get back to me.  XXXX/XXXX/15 : I check in to see what the status is ... also stating that Coastal has NOT updated my personal line of credit account which will reflect a XXXX balance ( instead it shows a {$4900.00} balance on a {$5000.00} limit since this is the information that was shown on XXXX/XXXX/15 ). This obviously pulls my credit score down. Another thing I reiterate is the fact that I have a Coastal HELOC in place ( with a high balance ), that is dropping my score as well. It 's viewed as a credit card when calculating the scores. Branch manager sends me an email saying that this information was based on the old report ... should have new credit pulled today. Wait, what??  XXXX/XXXX/15 : Branch manager emails me and states the score went up XXXX points ( XXXX ) and will not be enough to reinstate the lines of credit.

3946,"XXXX XXXX I set up a joint account for my mother and I. We needed a way to share funds because we are purchasing a house together. I signed up for an account online. I received an email stating I needed to send a bank statement to verify my identity, so I sent XXXX. I later received a call saying that was n't good enough because they tried calling my credit union to verify my information but the credit union would n't share information. Why call my credit union when everyone knows they 're not going to give out my information? Why ever ask for the bank statement in the first place if the statement itself was n't enough?   So then they asked for more information. I clearly explained to the person on the phone that I was at a new address and did not have any bills at the new address yet and my license still had my old address. He said I could send a copy of my license and a copy of a bill for the current address with my roommate 's info and that would be sufficient. I sent XXXX items and did not get a request for any additional information.   Then last week I got a check in the mail for my account balance and notification that my account was closed. When I called to find out why, they said the information was not sufficient. I asked why and they could not explain why because the notes did n't have any details. Then they said they could reopen the account. So I waited for a personal banker to get on the line, we went through my request, and they said I would be contacted within 1-2 days to let me know what information they needed to finish reopening the account.   A week later I had n't heard from anything so I called back. After 10 minutes on the phone, someone finally said that I could not reopen an account that had been opened online. Why was I told differently the previous week? Why did I waste a week waiting for a phone call that was never going to come? They want me to start the process all over without being able to explain to me why the previous documents were not enough and what I can do differently to make sure the account opens correctly. They want me to risk wasting a bunch of time trying to open this account again. I have now wasted a month and a half trying to set up an account.

I recently reviewed my checking account transaction history online for the month of XXXX and noticed an anomaly with a particular check I had written for a business expense in the amount of {$90.00}. The check shows as check number XXXX and had no image associated with it. This check 's actual number is XXXX. I called Capitalone360 customer service to notify them of the error and to request that the check details in my online checking transaction history be corrected. I was told the details could not be corrected at that time, but I could get a copy of the check through secure message. I received a copy of the check in PDF format which I appreciated. However, my checking account statement for XXXX documents the incorrect check number of XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX.  Today, I called Capital One 360 customer service to see if they could correct the check details in the transaction history. I spoke with Supervisor XXXX XXXX Employee ID # XXXX XXXX whom reached out to the check receiving department on my behalf to see what they could do. After a long hold, I was informed that the check details could not be corrected and that check # XXXX could not be changed to XXXX. The explanation was that when the bank that cashed the check XXXX XXXX XXXX sent the cashed check to capital one, XXXX entered in the wrong check number which in this case is XXXX. I was told that Capital One policy dictates that check detail information received from the bank that cashed the check had to stay intact in my online transaction history and also on my checking account statement even if that detail information was inaccurate.  I posed a hypothetical scenario XXXX. What if the Bank that cashed the check incorrectly coded the check number as XXXX? Since Capital one policy requires that information be kept intact when reflected in my transaction History and my checking account statement, would n't check # XXXX show up on my statement and transaction history? She agreed that according to policy, yes, XXXX would incorrectly show up on my statement as well as transaction history. I then asked that since Capital One policy states that statements ca n't be corrected, would n't I be stuck with a Bank statement that showed incorrect information for that hypothetical check transaction where check XXXX showed as check XXXX. She agreed that It would. This hypothetical situation is no different than the situation I am in now. Whether it 's check XXXX or check XXXX, the fact is that the transaction detail is wrong and I do n't have accurate documentation for my business transaction on my Bank statement.

As a result, on my recent trip to XXXX, I took little cash because I knew that I could get cash from the ATM. In fact, one of the reasons that I have a Bank of America ATM card is because I was assured by the bank that it would work overseas.

On the chance that something was wrong with my card, I tried my wife 's card ( we are on the same account ) and that did n't work either. At the time, we had a balance in our checking account of more than {$10000.00}, so it was not a question of insufficient funds. I called Bank of America from XXXX ( at substantial cost to me, given international rates ) and after the usual voice mail tree, wait, prolonged identification process, and a transfer, got to a person to whom I explained my problem. Her response was that the chip in my ATM card was so sophisticated that the XXXX banks could n't process it. This, of course, is ridiculous ; XXXX has been using chip cards for several years and my chip card from XXXX XXXX worked fine for charging items. She also indicated that there was nothing that Bank of America could do for me to get me a card that worked, or to get me funds.

I spoke to a representative who stated that they do not provide invoice numbers for toll transactions. I asked if we could contact the Turnpike Authority together via conference call, she stated she can not call outside companies. I said I would initiate the call, she refused. She gave no option to dispute the charges stating that XXXX has  probably already paid the charge and therefore the Administrative fee is accurate ''.

That is a 2,250 % processing charge!  Also, to note, The State Turnpike Authority stated they have had several calls recently from other consumers with the same complaint.

4062,"This is my fourth complaint about overdraft fees on my account. I am attaching documentation to show that Key Bank changes the order of credits and debits to accounts. I would appreciate someone from the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau to closely look at my documentation this time as I have copied my account over the last two days to show the discrepancies in accounting. This last overdraft I received because I moved XXXX $ from my standard checking to my son 's Hassle Free account. The reason my account over drew in the first place two days ago was because of the fees debited by Key Bank. On the ledger there is no sign of overdraft before the fees were debited. In response to the overdraft complaint yesterday, Key Bank sent a tutorial with a fictitious person named XXXX who is XXXX XXXX and very young. The tutorial says that she over drew her account buying coffee and donuts. Besides the very problematic racialization of XXXX, Key Bank blames the customer when actually what is happening is that Key Bank alters the timing of debits and credits in ways that incur overdrafts. My ledger shows several deposits in the last few days yet they mysteriously move around in the ledger as do debits. Once an overdraft is debited in accounts that are fragile ( meaning no overdraft protection attached and low balances ) these fees throw the account into disarray resulting in yet more overdraft fees. Please CFP look carefully at my account. I am not some crazy person continuing to complain. I am an educated woman who follows her account diligently and I am going to continue to complain because I know if this is happening to me, it 's happening to others who perhaps do not have the money to pay the fees. I have attached a short analysis in a document. It 's short becasue i really do not have time to do this every day. I want these fees to stop. I am probably going to receive yet another overdraft fee because my account was overdrawn this morning. The only reason my account is overdrawn is that Key Bank has debited excessive overdraft fees from my checking account..   ",wang1509@purdue.edu,0
4064,"Earlier this week I opened a new money market account online. My account is a joint account with my wife ; however, the process to open the new account online included me providing my driver 's license, and none of my wife 's information. Several days later, the new account appeared online, in their online banking system but did not display the interest rate ( likely under 1 % ). I called the XXXX number to speak with a customer service agent and they advised me that I was not on the account. I explained that the account was opened by me using my driver 's license. Also, I had authenticated with them with the password on my account. Since I was logged into their online banking portal, I could provide complete account number for all XXXX of my accounts, including a checking, XXXX savings, and a mortgage account. I asked to speak to a supervisor or manager so I could understand the protocol around authentication and account ownership. I was once again advised that I do not own or have access to the new savings account opened earlier this week.

4065,"I will begin with the fact that USAA is well known for manipulating their customers accounts. If you make a deposit or withdrawal they will move the dates in order for them to collect more fees. I actually have proof of this happening in my account. The most recent occurrence of my account being manipulated was on XXXX/XXXX/2015. I made an immediate withdrawal of {$1800.00} from a local branch which USAA partners with to obtain a cashier 's check in the entire amount withdrawn, similar to an ATM withdrawal but due to the amount it needs to be completed this way per USAA. However, my USAA account statement shows the withdrawal was made on XXXX/XXXX/2015 which is a significant deficit of days and cashiers checks are immediate. I kept all receipts of withdrawals to prove this. I also paid a bill which cleared after a deposit I made in the morning of the XXXX XXXX only to have it magically appear before the deposit, even though it was n't made until after the deposit was made. My next instance happened on XXXX/XXXX/2015 when I deposited via my phone a US Postal money order in the amount of {$310.00} in the morning at approximately XXXX XXXX it was later that day after my deposit which is immediate when made from the mobile device that one of my auto drafts for billing cleared. Once again my account was manipulated and my deposit was moved to after the ACH draft attempted to clear as to make it appear that no funds were available at that time so USAA in turn could charge me an overdraft fee. Then when my check which was written out to my housekeeper in the amount of {$85.00} cleared they once again manipulated my account and charged me not once but twice overdraft fees when you can clearly see on my account statement there were funds available and the check itself did clear the first time. When I spoke with a customer service rep, they told me they could not fix it because it was their computer who processes and they can only see the process. Now, if it is my money and I can see that enough is there to clear any debits or checks they can not do things behind the scenes in order to make more money. I am in the process of changing banks and I want the FTC to look into USAA and their practices as I am not the only service member who has experienced this. I want those fee 's refunded as there was money in my account and I also want their  system '' to reflect actual dates and times of transactions accurately.

I checked my balance online the morning of Tuesday, XXXX XXXX, and saw that the XXXX transactions had posted to his account and funds had been withdrawn, and the remaining balance was {$16.00}, then he went to ( local grocer ) and purchased some groceries for a total of {$32.00}. I realized that this transaction was going to cause an overdraft ( for which he has protection ) and he decided to make the purchase anyway, knowing he would be assessed an overdraft fee of {$37.00}. When payday came on XXXX XXXX, he got online in the evening to check the deposit and found that the balance was much less than he had calculated.

TCF is using this process of  pending '' transactions to assess more fees to the customer, and then blaming the merchants when there is a complaint.

They would either send me a check or I could get XXXX to do the transfer. At no time during this conversation, did BOA mention a fee for making this transfer. Since the IRS has strict rules about taking the money from an IRA and moving it on my own, I decided to ask Ally to do the transfer.

I contacted them and they said that they told XXXX about the fee and that XXXX should have informed me. They also said that this fee is stated on my quarterly statement. XXXX said that if BOA had told them about this fee, they would have instructed them to relay the information to me and that it was n't their responsibility to inform another bank 's customer of their fees.

Also, why are they entitled to a processing fee, when they refused to initiate the transfer and XXXX was the one who did all of the work? I spoke to several customer service people at BOA after this occurred and they maintain that they have a right to charge this fee. They may have this right, but is it fair, especially considering how small of an account this was.

Because of the available balances provided on my XXXX App by PNC and also PNC Atm receipts. Staff persons have condescending with me in most cases regarding my valid complaint and inquiry for additional information regarding my finances and my account. I 've filed XXXX complaints which I am waiting to hear back on. I asked about consumer rights/customer rights/ grievance policy in which the individual I spoke with had difficult divulging that information to me. I 've had an account with PNC since 1997. This year I 've had the most incidents with this bank then I ever have. No one is on XXXX accord resulting in the consumers ( in this case Me ) being misinformed results in the bank simply taking my money without transparent and legitimate explanation from individuals tasked with representing the organization. I believe the information accounting process needs to be reviewed for PNC bank and also the guidelines for over-drafting which comes with opting in. An option that I had no knowledge of for the first few years of my XXXX account.   ",mmaloof@purdue.edu,0

They are making me have every signer on the account come in and sign for my name change, keep in mind, no one else 's names or information were changed. I call the telephone banking number, I was initially told this should not be a problem and I should go back to the branch. I go back to the bank branch prepared with my legal documentation, again I was denied the ability to change my name without all of the other signers. The issue is, my father who is on the account, works out of state and there are no branches where he works. I call the telephone banking number again, I was told there is no way around this, but was told I could close my account with only my signature. I was also told this at the branch. Why I would want to close my account of 20 plus years and open a new XXXX, is beyond me. Especially when it would not fully resolve the issue, my name is on other accounts and I will not close my parents bank account. Bank of America offered to mail me a form to complete, I called twice on this form and kept being told  The form is on the way, give it time '' 2.5 months later, I am still waiting on said form.

'' It seems that the consumer IS being charged for pending transactions. Technically those funds should still be available for use for other transactions since the merchant has not sent it through for payment and IF when those pending items come to post in the future they THEN should be assessed fees should funds be unavailable.I was told it was assessed to a {$10.00} transfer to my other TD Bank account I share with my son.

When we called, the NFCU representative told us that our account had a negative balance. After inquiring why, they informed us that a check for {$1500.00} had not cleared and bounced, so they were taking the money from our account. They told us that someone had deposited a check electronically and removed the money from our account. We informed them that my family does not use checks, and the only money we put into our account is from Federal Agencies ( pay checks ). Then we found out what we needed to do to dispute this fraudulent activity. NFCU told us that if we went and got a police report and brought it in we would be refunded in less than 48 hours.   After obtaining the police report we brought it in to the branch in XXXX, GA. They said okay it will be refunded in less than 48 hours. 48 hours passed with no action. So three days later we called. Then we were informed that a gentleman and myself, XXXX XXXX, had showed up with the check at the branch in XXXX Georgia on XXXX XXXX, 2015, went to the counter and made the transaction. So therefore they would deny the fraud claim. But they stated they wanted an affidavit saying that I was not present in the location on XXXX XXXX, 2015, because they wanted to look at the cameras to see if it was actually me that showed up in the branch. We completed the Affidavit and gave it to the branch, but they refused to accept this affidavit and wanted me to sign XXXX provided by them. The next day our claim was denied again.   When we called to learn why they had denied our claim again, they told us that the man had come into the branch alone on XXXX XXXX, 2015, and that he was to deposit a check into our account and withdraw the cash value of the check. The check was made out for {$1500.00} and was made out to me. They said that NFCU called me to receive authority for the transaction to take place and that I authorized it.

In order to avoid any returned checks or transactions, I was prohibited from making any transfers of my own. This allegation that I exceed the XXXX transaction per month is the furthest from the truth and has caused me financial hardships of authorized e-checks being returned, my account being charge overdraft fees, and thus my checking account going into the negative.

This 'alert ' service is widely advertised as a part of the benefits of being a Chase banking or credit card customer.   Note that this alert service does require some 'setting up ', which I have done, and used successfully prior to this incident.   From XXXX XXXX 2015, the Chase alert service stopped working completely on all my accounts and Chase credit cards, and I have incurred substantial fees as a result of not receiving notifications of insufficient funds that would otherwise allow me to transfer or add funds in time to avoid such fees. Prior to this, I have used this service ritually with few issues, but on XXXX XXXX/XXXX/15, it began to fail completely, and Chase began to charge me ISF fees as a result.   Once I realised the issue, I contacted Chase Customer Service, and they insisted that their system was 'working fine ', and that I should set up alerts via 'Push ', Text and email just to be certain. I followed their advice and did so, ( receiving no less than XXXX emails confirming these changes to my alerts. However, despite setting up all alerts via all means, none of them worked at all.

Chase calls and writes constantly to add funds so as to bring my account/s back into credit, but I refuse to do so, as adding funds would serve only to pay Chase their ISF fees, and I am certain any request for refund would be denied.

When I received the letter and check I called Citibank 's customer service line. After 20 minutes on the phone where I asked if there were any known scams I was told to take the check to a local branch for verification. It seemed to make sense. However if you go to the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency website ( XXXX ) it states that you should never accept a check from someone you do n't know and that as the payee it is up to you to pursue the maker of the check.

I pay all of my credit cards on time, as well as my car note and I make a decent salary and have to do my banking via a Debit card, and I am tried of this.   Once a person is listed with XXXX it stays in the system for 7 years. Considering I had never had any banking issues outside of this matter with Bank of America or any other bank I should not be held in some type of  Digital Debtors Prison '' for 7 years.   XXXX is listed on this report as well, and no one can explain why. I applied for an account I was initially approved, I made a deposit, and a week or so later I was denied and my deposit was sent back to me in the form of a check. There were not any transactions what-so-ever so XXXX should not even be listed because it makes it look as if I did something wrong ; it reads ( closed for cause -Purge ) what cause?

I go to the auction, find reasonable used cars, if any repairs need to be performed then I will get them done to quickly sell the vehicle. XX/XX/XXXX I was referred to by my sister that she had a friend and coworker who was in desperate need of a cheap vehicle. I meet the young lady twice before. She decided that she wanted to by a ford escort from me. Because of her relationship with my sister I took a check from her for payment. The check amount was n't even the full amount for the vehicle but I took it anyway because she was a friend of the Family. I went to the drive thru and deposited cash and that check I received from her. That night my payroll hit my account. Two days later I withdrew cash out of my account to pay bills. I also used the debit card to pay bills online. Almost 3 days later while on my way to work I attempted to buy gas with my debit card and it was declined several times. I then went to the ATM to find out that my transaction was also declined. I immediately contact BOA customer service and then I was transferred to another department. Once I got someone on the phone they asked for pertinent information to identify me. The representative put me on hold for 2 to 3 minutes then came back to inform me that my accounts was closed due to the check I deposited. The funds were not available or the account was closed. I explained to the representative what happened, and who the person was that the check originated from. The representative then went on to explain that the account was too new and that BOA had a right to cancel my accounts at their own discretion. She then told me that I should immediately STOP my direct deposit from coming to the accounts because I would n't have access to it. Because of BOA closed the account the final balance reflected a negative balance because of the returned funds. I did n't find out about the negative balance until months later.

If the bank had any real concerns about this as a long term issue then why would me telling them to release the hold be enough for them to release the hold. I also find the reasoning for the hold to be dubious in the extreme. To state the reason for the hold was because of overdrafts, then not allow a deposit into the account would seem counter-intuitive. Unless of course the bank wants the clients to have more overdrafts, which it does because it then slaps a {$20.00} charge on each overdraft. Wells Fargo 's actions in this situation are deplorable and should be held with utter contempt. It seems rather clear from my perspective that Wells Fargo was looking for an opportunity to slap additional charges on me by unlawfully controlling the timing in which deposits are allowed into the account.

4263,"Five years ago I went to Wells Fargo to get a CD for {$5000.00} for five years for 1/2 % interest. Last week was the five-year maturity date, I went to the bank to cash it out and was told that Wells Fargo gave me the wrong product five years ago. I did n't know this at the time, that the product I was given was not the product I asked for. The manager explained that usually when people come in and ask for a CD, it 's because their accountant told them to get a retirement account. Wells Fargo thought that 's what I was asking for. Five years ago, the Wells Fargo banker was n't listening to me and gave me the wrong product? I do n't have enough knowledge to know it was the wrong product. I ask for a {$5000.00} cd at 1/2 % interest for five years and Wells Fargo gives me the paperwork to sign, which I do, not understanding the difference between what I asked for and a retirement CD.   This morning a manager from Wells Fargo Branch in XXXX XXXX, CA on XXXX and XXXX XXXX XXXX. ( where this deal originated ) to let me know that because I signed their paperwork, there is nothing they can do to remedy this situation. So Wells Fargo got my {$5000.00} for five years and I 'm told that not only will I not get the $ XXXX interest I thought I earned, but I will be penalized for taking the money out  early '' when I turn XXXX years old in XXXX ( have to wait until XXXX or I 'll be penalized even more! ) I will get less than my initial {$5000.00}, because 11 % will be deducted to pay state and federal taxes or fees or whatever you want to call my hard earned money that I get to give away. Wells Fargo benefits from keeping my money for five years without having to pay me anything and the government gets their fees, and I get to pay both of them for my trouble.   These too big to fail banks are getting away with too much, they need to be broken up. Why is it that they can launder drug money ( Wells Fargo bought Wachovia ), crash the economy in 2008 by selling loans to people who could n't repay them, take billions in taxpayer money to recoup their losses, pay lobbyists to weaken the new legislation trying to rein them in, and steal money from people like me who have no leverage make them to do what is right and correct their mistakes - with no negative consequences for the banks?   I used to work as a XXXX. When my clients were about to sign disclosures and contracts, I sat down with them and reviewed each paragraph to make sure they understood what they were signing, I had a fiduciary responsibility to do so and I took that responsibility very seriously. Wells Fargo should have taken the time to review with me what I was signing to make sure I was getting what I asked for. I hope you can help me. Thank you. PS : I 'm voting for XXXX XXXX because he 'll work to break up these banks, they are doing so much harm to all us and our economy.   ",bbrumfi@purdue.edu,0

Specifically, in going through my records in order to better understand how I could resolve ongoing identity theft, I discovered that when applying for a bank account at Scottrade Bank, Scottrade Bank improperly handled a number of documents which had very personal information on them. The actions of Scottrade Bank not only broke from the current standards of data security but also broke Scottrade Bank 's internal policies regarding handling customer information.   Specifically, on or around XXXX XXXX, 2013 XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX XXXX, a regional manager from Scottrade Bank offered to receive Scottrade Bank account application documents via email. Email is a notoriously insecure medium of communication yet XXXX XXXX allowed and offered to receive the documents via email, despite the fact that it was against Scottrade Bank 's internal policies and does not have any of the normal safeguards in place to handle personal customer information. The XXXX XXXX, 2013 email contained PDF attachments that included my full name, signature, address, bank account numbers, Social Security Number, and other very personal and sensitive information.   As is clear by Scottrade 's online disclosures and policies, Scottrade Bank states that it will never transmit customer information over email and or ask for or receive personal information via email, however, XXXX XXXX, a manager at Scottrade encouraged me to send the information by email to expedite the process, with no disclose of the security concerns.   I am writing today to ask Scottrade to explain why they let my personal information be transmitted in a way that puts me at significant risk to identity theft. I would also like to know what the current status of the email and personal information is, has it been deleted, has it been accessed, are emails records secure, who could have gained access, was the email accessed XXXX, was it confirmed a secure connection?   The actions of XXXX XXXX, put me at my personal information at risk and could have likely been the direct cause for hackings that happened weeks latter and accounted for over XXXX of fraud.

4363,"My wife and I have an active savings and checking account with Suntrust Bank. We began to to experience a problematic series of overdraft charges beginning in XXXX of 2013. My wife had enrolled us in an service they promoted as being able to help us with possible overdrafts to our account in order to ensure that our large bills such as rent and car payments would not be affected by a late processing deposit or refund from a return etc. Starting in XX/XX/XXXX and continuing for several months, we began to notice that purchase or payments made over the course of several days were processed or posted to our account in a very irregular pattern. We would pay for or purchase items on a Monday and see those post to our account sometimes as much as three or four days afterwards. What bothered us was that we would see these post to our account on the same day as purchases made several days later. An example might be where we would pay our rent on a Monday, make several purchases over the next several days and then have ALL of these transactions post on the same day incurring, several hundred dollars in overdraft fees. I made dozens of calls to understand why this was occuring and Suntrust  offered '' to refund to me XXXX or XXXX of those charges when I confronted them on their admitted practice of batching our transactions from highest to lowest instead of by date of transaction. We had never been provided information on how they would process our transactions and in what order. I evenetually was forced to de-enroll our accounts in the overdraft coverage protection and advised Suntrust over a recorded call to disallow any future transactions when our account no longer had sufficient funds for any purchase due to pending account transactions that would result in our account balance being depleted.  Thankfully the overdraft fees APPEARED TO BE stopped and we were able to begin to recover HOW to recover from over {$2500.00} in over draft fees incurred during that time. Recently we have begun to see overdraft fees AGAIN applied to our account despite the fact that we were specifically informed that any purchase made on our account when we had insufficent funds for the purchase would be automatically denied. This has resulted in us incurring an unexplained an unknown overdraft fee amount totaling upwards of {$400.00} more dollars and in all appears to be over the last two years in excess of $ XXXX-XXXX in overall fees from Suntrust. I have included as many financial statements as I could acquire but can not gain access to those from 2013 when this all began. Suntrust informed me that the charges were due to purchases made using our  account '' and their  routing '' numbers and not through a credit/debit purchase which they would have denied. This did not make sense as neither myself or my wife have at any point given this information to the retailer 's or services that the new overdraft fees had been attached to. We have in the last two to three months incurred several hundred more dollars in  overdraft fees '' despite never being re-enrolled in any type of service offered by Suntrust, not agreeing to any such service, and having been informed that any such activity in the future would not incur overdraft fees.

According to the ledger balance before checking my balance there was a positive balance of {$18.00} on XXXX/XXXX/2015. This figure was double checked by adding back the pending transactions in case there was something not seen on the computer ledger. According to my personal records, the balance was accurate.

If they are to charge by the authorization date ( pending date ), there should have only been XXXX overdraft charge.

Why does a citizen have to take a bank to court when the United States Government has already declared that bank a thief and required them to pay up a tiny percentage of the money they stole? Why should anybody have to repay a bank to get their record clean when the US Government completely agrees with the consumer. Can the US Government fine XXXX and PNC bank for stealing from honest hard working Americans?   Maybe that is why the US Economy is having a rough time - banks are stealing too much. A little fraud can go undetected for an incredibly long time but a lot of fraud is noticeable immediately. If the entire United States economy has noticed this type of fraud, are we not supposed to be able to protect ourselves from thieves inside of our own country? Is the US Government not supposed help citizens when there is a monopoly that is causing issues and grief within the public.   How does a bank steal money from US citizens in the midst of a recession, then get a bail out from congress for billions of dollars, while at the same time continuously playing predator toward poor, underprivileged, and minority citizens?   Is this a democracy or a fascist state?   ",feng83@purdue.edu,1

In XXXX XXXX, my former spouse, years after divorce, made a late payment ( 30 days past due ) on her Macy 's card ( XXXX ) an oversight on her part ). I had no idea my name was still associated with the account. Macy 's placed this late payment on my credit report, even though I do not receive, pay or have access to my divorced spouse 's bills. How could I possibly know enough to be responsible for this payment? My name was to be removed from this account as part of the divorce.  Even further, though I have excellent credit and on-time payment history, including for any number of charge cards, I was turned down for my own Macy 's card based on this one item. For decades, Macy 's has been my favorite store. Why turn away good customers? On principle, though reluctantly I avoid shopping at my long-term favorite store.

What started my research are the transactions that occurred overnight between XX/XX/XXXX and XX/XX/2016.  At XXXX on XX/XX/XXXX I checked my account on my mobile device and it said I had {$49.00} in the bank and I went to the grocery store and spent {$46.00}.

This was after a deposit that occurred overnight of {$250.00}. When I talked to BofA they told me that the available amount reflected on my mobile device did not include processing transactions, and in my account history it shows that my balance was really {$37.00} at the time of the purchase and a XXXX draft came through for {$9.00} that caused the XXXX overdraft fee.

4524,"I am the Co-Executor of my Mothers estate. My Mother had an IRA account with Bank of America. She had this IRA since at least 1992 and always banked at the same small branch in XXXX, Connecticut. The branch was taken over several times between XX/XX/XXXX-XX/XX/XXXX and is now Bank of America. Despite there being XXXX totally consistent beneficiary designations with the predecessor banks being located- XXXX located by Bank of America in its own internal files, Bank of America refuses to honor them -- saying that they will only honor a beneficiary designation directly with them. In addition to the XXXX beneficiary designation forms, I have notes by my mother consistently reasserting that I am the sole beneficiary.  Also Bank of America has consistently intentional or just negligently given me misleading and false information. The second beneficiary designation was located by them only after they had repeatedly represented that there was No such record. They have also incorrectly ( intentionally or negligently ) represented that there is no detriment since they are willing to pay the IRA to the Estate. The Bank should be aware of the detrimental tax consequence of the payment to an Estate rather than a person beneficiary -- even if ignorant they should at least not make false statements on which their depositors may rely to their detriment. My mother was not a wealthy woman ; she carefully saved her money and meticulously set up her accounts in accordance with her wishes. Yet now, the Bank is looking to VIOLATE her wishes and her accounts! Additionally, since there are other beneficiaries of the residuary estate, clear, contrary to the Bank 's rep payment to the Estate is very different than payment to the individual named beneficiary.   My mother was already aged XXXX at the time of the Bank of America takeover and XXXX when she died and she consistent banked at the same small branch.The Bank 's position seems to be that that it was somehow her responsibility to make sure that Bank of America still had and did not lose or misplace her Beneficiary Designation. Likely, this is a frequent problem with Bank of America -- the only difference here is the careful records that my mother kept and my relentless pursuit to correct the situation.

On Friday, XXXX/XXXX/16, I took my sister to the airport and paid for {$2.00} worth of parking, and we got some ice cream for my kids. Since I had n't used my card since the day before, I was sure I had enough to cover the {$15.00} ice cream and the {$2.00} parking, which would have left my balance at {$22.00}. I did n't see this as a problem as I had a deposit that the depositing bank had emailed me about that stated it was due to post to my bank account on XX/XX/XXXX. I assumed that would occur, and either way my balance was positive. That night I paid {$15.00} toward a presidential campaign donation. Right before I went to bed, I wondered why my bank had not yet posted my deposit, but still I had a positive amount of money in my account. Saturday, I woke and looked at my account, hoping the deposit had finally posted. It had not, and I had now a negative balance, due to XXXX overdraft charges that were erroneously charged to my account beginning with the XXXX XXXX charge. So, this here is the problem. At no time prior to that morning, did my account say I was negative, nor did it say I did n't have enough to cover the very first charge I made, that they say made me overdraw.

When Wells Fargo was contacted about the mistake, they had no record of my automatic payment cancellation.

Moreover I specifically went to see my personal Banker about one month prior to this transaction and personally opted out of any overdraft protection for fear of something like this would happen. As soon as I caught the fraudulent transaction I immediately contacted the bank. After a week or so I went to see my personal banker and he made some phone calls regarding the travesty, I do n't know who he was speaking to but he did remind whoever it was that I had no overdraft protection, and made reference to a small transaction sometime ago at XXXX which was denied due to insufficient funds. He actually was arguing and at one point, pointed out about how a small grocery transaction could be denied but yet a {$1700.00} could slip through. For whatever reason the person on the other end, cut the conversation short, and I was given an excuse for them allowing it. It through me into such a daze, I cant even remember what exactly was said. I formally disputed the matter sending XXXX XXXX several document via email showing what it was XXXX had been doing. Long story short both the bank and XXXX had been making banking mistakes and I should not have to be the one paying for it. I have struggled most of my life from XXXX issues which in turn caused me problems to ruin my credit. I have been doing well for several years now and have been making some headway in trying to repair my credit, I wanted to try and buy a home here as a first time home buyer but now I cant even get a car loan. It has brought me to the point of XXXX because of all the financial hardships Both Huntington and XXXX have caused, I would never authorise and amount that I could n't cover and every single time I called XXXX, I made XXXX well sure the money was there at the time to cover it, as I did with all business.  I returned the car in better shape than it was when I rented it.   ",feng83@purdue.edu,0

4713,"For almost a year now, Wells Fargo has been reordering my bank charges in order to maximize overdraft fees. In other words, they change the dates on my charges so that they can either charge me overdraft fees, or if I already have an overdraft charge, they will change the dates on my purchases in order to charge me multiple overdraft fees. They will also purposely withhold transactions so that my balance looks higher than it really is. Then, when my balance gets low enough they will process all of the transactions that they withheld causing me multiple overdraft fees. Here 's an example : On XXXX/XXXX/16 I checked my checking balance and it was roughly {$140.00}, so I went and bought a few grocery items that I needed. Now, fast forward to XXXX/XXXX/16.

After answering all the identity questions from this representative ( address, social security number, and finally drivers license number ) she looked into my accounts. What had happened was that a card from an old account that I closed had been sent and this is why I could not activate it. After my question was answered, this rep proceeded to ask me if I was employed, what colleges I have attended, and what jobs I had worked at. Then she asked if I were going on vacation! I actually thought she was going to ask me what my net worth was! She then proceeded to insult me and say 'I do n't know why you are activating a check card with only this amount of money in your account '.

My identity was already verified and she was just being nosy. Charles Schwab never knew where I worked or what colleges I attended so this information was not used to verify anything.

4751,"My husband and I have had a joint account for 20 years at the same bank. We have been loyal customers and have a checking, a savings, and a couple money market accounts. Over the years, the services have become less generous and recently I have had two very bad experiences that I do not think are legal. First, my bankcard and access to my bank account was cut off because I had not activated a new card that they had sent to me 5 months ago ( that I never received ). When I realized I could not get access to my account, I called and they said they would send me a new card in two days. I had no access to my account electronically or physically and I was unable to transfer money to cover a property tax check. My husband had to go to the bank to do it. Which brings me to the next complaint. We used to have over {$14000.00} credit as an overdraft account. As a busy household with XXXX incomes and young kids, we used this overdraft account often for credit whenever we needed the flexibility for timing of expenses. We have paid plenty of interest to the bank for this flexibility. Late last year the account was reduced to {$300.00}. This amount for us covers very little when you are talking about {$12000.00} of activity during the course of a month. We did get a letter from the bank saying that they were reducing it due to  my husband 's delinquency '' ( there were none - it is a joint account under good standing ) ;  insufficient deposit relationship '' ; and I was listed as an  unqualified co-borrower ''. None of this made sense. When I went to the bank recently, I inquired about it and they said I would have to reapply for it like any other credit source. They also said the reduction was due to a low credit score and debt to income ratio. How would they know what my debt to income ratio was? They said we could see his credit report. Why did they use just his credit report and not mine for a joint account? My credit score and earnings are much higher. We have always paid our bills on time and do not have any debt under this bank anymore. ( I suspect we are being punished for moving our debt elsewhere. ) I believe these actions have been, at worst, discriminatory and illegal ; and, at best, very bad customer service. Reducing our credit line is the same thing as raising interest rates on a credit card. It has resulted in overdraft and several fees.   ",bbrumfi@purdue.edu,0

Wells Fargo could very easily contact us but they choose not to.  I am surprised this type of thing is not being used by world wide scammers ... ... ... ... ..it seems like a perfect scam.

4760,"I issued a check to an air conditioning repair company for a job they did fixing an electrical circuit that shorted. The vendor then cashed the check which was fine, they then destroyed the check. However, somehow the check was found having been destroyed by being torn into shreds, it was then taped together and a new payee was rewritten on the top of the check over the vendors name and redeposited. The same exact check was thus deposited other than the obvious sign that its payee had been changed, the same check number, date, account number and routing number were used. It was apparent that electronic check deposit must of been used to cash the check both times since neither time the bank required it to be kept. I contacted the bank regarding the fraud and they stated since it was over 60 days that they were no longer liable and that I was, however, I read in the commercial code that the bank cited that the bank must first utilize reasonable care which it did not since it was a check that was obviously a fraud and was deposited twice, any individual could deposit a check multiple times and receive payment each time. Also according to consumer regulartions I read the following ; Unauthorized EFTs Not Involving an Access Device : Comment XXXX it clearly states that had they been notified within the 60 day period and been able to delay payment they would have I then notified the bank regarding this and that they must investigate it but they would not, they simply put me on hold for a long time transferred me around and then said someone would call me back and I never received any additional notice.  I then read that the CFPB helps to enforce the rules and regulations devised to maintain the order of business so I hope that something can be done to ensure that the bank maintain its requirement to do a reasonable job to prevent fraud and that they must investigate and unless it could 've been prevented had they been notified within 60 days they are still liable and must reimburse my cost of this check. I have cited the section below ; The consumer liability rules are slightly different when an unauthorized EFT does not involve an access device. Most important, the XXXX tiers of liability do not apply ; that is, the institution may not hold a consumer liable for any portion of any unauthorized EFT not involving an access device that occurred on or before the 60th calendar day after the institution 's transmittal of the periodic statement showing the first unauthorized EFT.XXXX Instead, an institution may only hold the consumer liable for an unauthorized EFT not involving an access device if the transfer occurred more than 60 calendar days after transmittal of a periodic statement showing the first unauthorized EFT out of the consumer 's account and before the consumer gives notice to the financial institution, provided the institution establishes that the unauthorized EFT would not have occurred had the consumer notified the institution within the 60-day period.

XXXX XXXX on XX/XX/XXXX at XXXX and requested past Bank Statements for the period between XX/XX/XXXX-XX/XX/XXXX. She promptly pulled up the account on her computer screen and even pointed out the initial deposit on XX/XX/XXXX. Reported to me that it was open in credit status only because there were notes for pending research on fees that were supposed to be reversed over 5 years ago. She then, despite my verbal opposition and the court order in front of her, insisted that she had to close the account because I was getting divorced and should not have a joint account with my spouse and that we were no longer eligible for any applicable credits. She then assured me I would have the requested statements within 2 weeks ( records over 7 years old require the processing of a research fee-despite my physically viewing the XX/XX/XXXX Statement on XXXX XXXX 's Screen ). She then informed me that it would cost about {$180.00} in fees and that I would have to come into the branch and pay that when I pick of the Statements, implied to be just after XX/XX/XXXX.

A week later ( approximately ), I received XXXX new debit cards with XXXX different numbers, separately, by mail. I tried to activate both of them. XXXX would not activate, with a message saying the card was invalid. The other did activate, so I continued using that XXXX when I made debit card purchases.  Over the next month, I noticed that online transactions that I had authorized using the old debit card I had reported lost, continued to be put through my account. Some examples included online memberships, like XXXX, as well as some trial magazine subscriptions. I wondered how they were being processed, because I never updated these companies with my new debit card number.

I called the customer service of the bank to dispute this debit card transaction. The agent put me on hold to investigate, then came back on the line to tell me that there were XXXX debit cards associated with my checking account. In other words, the debit card that I had reported lost was never cancelled, and transactions that I had previously authorized on the lost card, like online memberships, etc, were still being put through my account.

On XXXX XXXX I had just come back from a trip and had forgotten to make a deposit to my account prior to leaving. I checked my bank balance online and saw that there was {$910.00} in the account. Before the bank closed I made a deposit of {$2300.00} to the account. Later in the evening I went online to download my account to XXXX. The deposit amount was shown as received by teller and a check that I had written for {$1100.00} had not cleared, nor was it shown as pending. The next day I received an overdraft charge of {$35.00} and they claimed that the check for {$1100.00} had cleared on XXXX XXXX. Their online banking had never shown that check. When I told them that I had made that deposit on XXXX XXXX their answer was that I only get {$100.00} of that to apply until the next day. I have argued with them about that but they refuse to remove the {$35.00}.   On a different account the next day a similar situation happened. I had forgotten to deduct a check I had written. There was a check I mailed to a vendor on Sat. XXXX XXXX. On Mon. XXXX XXXX that check money was debited from my account. I was overdrawn by {$56.00} and they charged my account {$36.00} for the overdraft. I run a business and on XXXX XXXX I had XXXX deposits of {$130.00} that are processed by that bank and go into that account. On Monday XXXX XXXX that XXXX deposit appeared as pending, and they did not count that money as covering the overdraft.   Here is my concern in a nutshell. The banks can immediately debit my account for checks that I write and mail to a vendor, but checks that are accepted by me and deposited in my account are held for XXXX day and do not apply to my account. That applies to cash deposits as well. If my deposit and a check come in on the same day they count the XXXX but not the other. I understand this would happen if XXXX uses an electronic transfer and set a date for the debit to be made or use a debit card, but checks that are written by someone and ones received and deposited by that person should be handled the same way. Either these checks that are scanned should show as pending on an account the same as any other check, or deposits should be treated as immediately available if overdraw situations occur. The way they are doing it now allows banks to take your money and use it for a day with deposits, but they can immediately cash your checks and remove the money from the account without it going through a pending process.

No letter of any sort was mailed to me informing me that my claims had in fact been denied. I was told that decision was made back on XX/XX/XXXX.  I was denied disputed transaction claims on the grounds that there was a  pattern of use '', therefore denying me of any refund for the lost funds.

I was told this could only be done by the Branch Manager at the XXXX XXXX Banking Center, since that was where the account was opened.   I made several attempts to contact the Branch Manager at the XXXX XXXX Banking Center over the next XXXX business days but was told each time that she was either  with a customer '' or  unavailable '' I did manage to speak with her once, on XXXX/XXXX/2015.

I noted that the managers of both the XXXX and the XXXX XXXX locations had claimed that only the other had the authority to lift the hold, ultimately admitting to me that the Branch Manager at XXXX XXXX was the correct party to release my funds. The social media person then told me that  if I could prove the check had cleared, then the bank would release the funds. All of this took place after being told that that the bank 's policy was to hold checks from 2-5 days to clear. When I pointed out the policy was XXXX that appeared to be selectively enforced, it was then she told me she would release the funds if I could prove the check had cleared.   I suggested then that she probably had that information right in front of her. Her response was that the funds would not be released due to the banks 's XXXX hold policy. I pointed out to her that the Uniform Commercial Code provided that once the bank had actual knowledge the check had been presented and paid, I was legally entitled to the funds, and the bank was NOT legally holding the funds. She said it did n't matter that she could probably see on the computer in front of her that the check had cleared.

About three months after I had completed the above requirements, I had not yet received my promotional credit, so I went into the branch and they told me that I should be seeing the credit by the end of XXXX. Come XXXX, I stopped into the branch office again to bring up the issue. They looked into my account and confirmed that I had met the requirements, but would have to investigate further because they do n't have any information on which teller opened the account for me or the promotional code that she entered for my account. A few days later, they called to tell me that they could n't find my name and address in the record of people that they distributed that specific promotion to. Unfortunately, I did not have this coupon saved from six months ago, so there was no way for me to show them the coupon that I clearly remember receiving in my mail. After speaking to the manager about the situation, he offered to credit {$100.00} to my account and told me there was nothing else they could do because my name did n't show up in their list of  selected individuals '' to receive that promotional credit. I feel like Citizens is using misleading promotional offer as a marketing scam to attract new customers and then hoping they either forget about the actual credit or telling them months later that they are n't eligible to receive the offer after they had already completed the stated requirements.

When my daughter attempted to make a teller cash withdrawal on XXXX XXXX, 2015, she and I were advised by bank staff that our account was overdrawn in the amount of {$1800.00}.

In explicably, TD Bank has denied our claim, citing as the basis for its decision, the fact that no additional transactions were attempted after the checks deposited were returned as counterfeits and because the transactions were consistent with our normal usage pattern. XXXX 's actions in this matter are a flagrant violation of Reg E and raise a question as to whether it 's policies in this area are in conformance with the requirements of the regulation.

The criminal procedure has been going on in the XXXX for decades, and as financial specialists estimate, people are robbed in the range of $ 40- {$60.00} XXXX annually. This is an intentional manipulation of bank accounts.   The bankers absolutely can not defend themselves by the client agreement because in practice it is not an agreement for dictatorship. Once I asked a banker if he will open an account for me if I refuse to pay late/overdraft fees, he answered : NO. To a question if he can block my account when I use all my funds, he answered : NO.   And the problem is very simple ; accounts should be blocked when the deposit is down to zero.   This is how it 's handled in XXXX where I was in XXXX.

When I called customer service they were of no help, I explained to them that I made a deposit in my account on Sunday before the next business day as their policy states so I should not have been charged with the OD. But the rep told me that there was nothing they could do for me, given that my account was over drafted due to their fees, I was unable to use it so I was shocked to find out that TD then charged me an extra {$35.00} OD fee for an attempted charge on my account. I apparently had an auto transfer set up for my savings account, which was attempted but not successful since I no no funds in my account. Yet TD still charged me {$35.00} for the attempted transfer which I explained to them was automatic and that I was n't aware of. It is n't fair that I have to pay a fee because someone else tried to debit my account and they did not honor their own policy of not charging me an overdraft fee until the next business day. So they have now succeeded in charging me {$220.00} in fees for being over drafted {$10.00}, that is beyond excessive. When I went into a nearby TD branch, the banker told me that they charged me because I apparently had Over draft protection on my card which allows transactions to go through even when funds are low. I told him no one ever explained to me how the over draft protection worked. Why in the world would I want purchases to clear on my card if there were no fund and I had to pay fees for it later, that just makes no sense and I would never agree to such a thing. They mislead people with that program. They also charged me over draft fees for 2 purchases I made on a Thursday when I had funds in my account, however TD charged me for the purchases the following Tuesday. When I complained, the customer service rep told me that TD reorders your purchases, so the highest amount gets cleared first before the lower amount. This is beyond absurd, so they basically held my purchases from thursday XXXX purchases I made when I had money in my account ) and waited till I made new purchases and reordered them. So purchases made later where processed first because the amounts were higher and XXXX proceeded to charge me for the thursday purchase the following Tuesday. This is an unfair practice, when I purchase something on my card I expect it to go through right away, not held until I make a larger purchase and reordered. This is ridiculous and is how they put their customers into Over draft so that they can collect fees. This is the worst bank ever, its one thing after the next with them and their customer service is never helpful. I 'm just sick and tired of them taking advantage of their customers.

For some unknown reason they stopped asking what my password was. I had noted that when I called because the person answering the call did not ask me, nor the next person.

5236,"Dear Sir, MadamThursdays are one of my days off. It is also the days I get paid, late in the day to the wee hours of Friday from one of my jobs. Both of my paychecks have always deposited with JP Morgan. Last Thursday being almost virtually with no money but compelled to do my grocery shopping considering the fact that I will be back at my 14 hours a day schedule for the next three days ( Fridays, Saturdays and Sundays ), with no time to do those chores, I waited well into the afternoon and ran these errands. When I do this, JP Morgan Chase will substract the amount of my groceries shopping from the pay checks that were being deposited by my employers. Or this bank could decide to charge me. There is no clear rule as to why it has this option because JP Morgan Chase is the only party that is in the position to say when my checks were deposited and decide to charge penalties or not to charge penalties. And it did charge penalties, three times, last Thursday going into Friday. And it charged me penalties many times due to this fact that the bank is the only one to say whether or not deposits were made before the cut off time : penalties for overdraft on annuities, penalties on tax returns until the IRS issued specific recommendations. So, I believe the latest penalties JP Morgan charged me again are abusive and would like it to refund me those. I am not in a position to check the time it said my pay check was deposited into my account and I suspect many times JP Morgan delayed the time a deposit should be credited to my account in order to charge penalties.

In contacting Wells Fargo today, they were unable to provide any explanation of why these payments were authorized and overdraft fees were charged, contrary to what has occurred on my account in the past. The only suggestion they could provide was that perhaps the merchant/vendor had done something different with the payments. To that end, I contacted the customer service of a specific merchant ( XXXX ) to check to see the payment they submitted on XXXX XXXX differed in any way from previously pre-authorized payments. Per their customer service, it did not. I was also advised that XXXX submitted another pre-authorized payment attempt on XXXX XXXX which was also declined by Wells Fargo. So far in contacting Wells Fargo, I have been unable to determine either why payments in the past they claim should have been authorized were not, nor why payments these payments were authorized, despite of payments for the same amounts from the same vendors in the past being declined. I suspect, though can not confirm, that there exists some rule within Wells Fargo ( perhaps unknown to their customer service representatives ) that overdraft transactions are somehow authorized or declined based off of account balances.

Additionally, I took a loan in XXXX XXXX and was offered the same program again by phone and was not asked my employment status. So it seems to me that this is a predatory practice by the credit union to have folks join by phone without offering any disclosures about program limitations. The bait and switch practice is to have unsuspecting customers pay for the program and when unfortunate circumstances arise and the program is needed it is only then that the company comes up with  disclosure '' reasons not to provide the coverage or provide the benefits paid for.

Since XX/XX/XXXX, I have in good faith maintained this program to avoid having this type of situation occur. Navy Federal needs to be accountable and honor the goal of the program as it was sold to me instead of compounding an already difficult situation. The company 's attempt to refund fees for the service is insulting and a shameful attempt to exploit the desperation of my situation and a cheap alternative to not honor its obligation.

After returning home from the bank, I sent an email to the renter to notify that the check was deposited. On XXXX XXXX I received word from the renter that he had seen the deposit. I then requested a receipt and phone number but did not receive either XXXX. Later that day I had my son get on the XXXX website where I found the rental. He inquired about the property and received an email that it was available on the exact dates I just paid for. This obviously was a vacation rental scam. The next day I went back to Bank of America and told my situation to a customer service representative and he contacted their fraud department with all the information I had that included the contract, deposit receipts and website information. Since it was obvious that the rental was a scam, I asked that the check be placed on hold. Remember that {$850.00} was not going to available until XXXX which would give ample time for the fraud department to act upon the scam. Bank of America DID ABSOLUTELY NOTHING! They allowed the check to go through and I 'm now out of {$1000.00}. Because of this incompetence I have had to spend hours closing my checking account, filing a police report, contacting sure pay accounts, filing a scam report and spending time talking to your representative. Why have a fraud department if they 're not going to do anything?   ",reynol79@purdue.edu,1

5262,"My daughter passed away XXXX XXXX, 2015 from XXXX. I flew to XXXX on XXXX XXXX to take care of everything that must be done in a tragic situation such as this, including asking Wells Fargo to place a debit hold on her checking/savings accounts until I could sort out her affairs ( I have access to both ). Once I had taken care of the funeral home, personal items and apartment in XXXX, I was able to review her financial matters after returning home to XXXX. My daughter was only XXXX years old, and naturally did not have a will at that age. She had never married and never had any children. She had been living in XXXX for about XXXX years, but only 9 months in the XXXX area. Once I had settled all of her finances, including depositing her last paycheck, the refunds I received from her car and medical insurance companies and the deposit from her apartment, I brought all of my documentation proving my relationship to XXXX ( see attached ) to the Wells Fargo bank in XXXX, XXXX. There was was told that once 45 days had passed I just needed to provide a  small estate affidavit '' to close her account. I researched the small estate rules for XXXX ( see attachment ) and learned my daughter did not have enough money to cover her liabilities ( after my deposits {$1600.00} total combined in Checking/Savings ) so she does not quality. I also researched probate and discovered the cost of just opening probate for an estate without a will is {$2500.00}, again she did not qualify as the total sum of her estate is nearly {$1000.00} less than that. I then contacted a probate attorney in XXXX for advise on what was needed to prove that as the single adoptive parent I was her only heir, so her funds could be put toward her funeral home bill ( {$4000.00} see attached ). The probate attorney in XXXX advised me that nothing more than notarized affidavits from XXXX dis-interested parties who had known my daughter since childhood attesting to the fact that she had never married and never had children should be needed. Anything beyond that would cost more than the amount of money in her 'estate '. I paid the attorney {$400.00} to prepare those affidavits and XXXX witnesses who had known my daughter since childhood had them signed and notarized. I returned to Wells Fargo bank and was then told that the documentation provided was not sufficient because the amount of money in the account was over {$1000.00}, I would need court statement naming me the heir instead. I contacted the attorney in XXXX and she informed me she had no knowledge of any such limitation or rule in XXXX law. I asked her how much it would cost for a court document and she quoted me attorney fees of {$2000.00} plus $ XXXX {$750.00} additional fees and the need for me to travel to Texas for the proceeding - clearly exceeding ( by far ) the amount of funds in my daughter 's accounts ( see attached ). I contacted the XXXX XXXX in XXXX XXXX and spoke with numerous individuals, none of which knew of any {$1000.00} limit within XXXX law nor whom found an estate with only {$1600.00} to be feasible to process through any court proceedings. There are no provisions in XXXX for the filing of a court defined heir by the heir. At this point I contacted the XXXX Attorney General 's office for their help. They advised me to log a complaint with Wells Fargo, The Treasure Department/Comptroller of Currency and the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau because none of this makes sense - to expect an heir to spend more money to obtain proof of heirship than is available to be recovered. Instead Wells Fargo intends to collect {$10.00} per month for checking the {$5.00} per month for savings until the funds are exhausted or 7 years has passed, at which time they will give any remaining money to the state of XXXX.

5393,"On XXXX XXXX 2015 ( Monday, XXXX/XXXX/15 ), I was the victim of an identity theft on my personal checking account from Regions Bank. My account was defrauded {$500.00}. Additionally, as the ATM used for the fraudulent transaction was operated by XXXX, my account was deducted {$4.00} in ATM usage fees from XXXX, {$2.00} in ATM usage fees from Regions, and {$2.00} in account balance verification fees from Regions. Altogether, my personal checking account from Regions was defrauded {$500.00}. Upon discovering that I was the victim of an identity theft, I immediately contacted Regions Bank and informed them of the fraud. I explained to Regions that my debit card was in my possession the entire time, was never stolen/missing, and was never given to any other individual for use. Whether by skimming or another card hacking device or technique, my card and pin were compromised and used at a local ATM for theft. I was instructed by Regions to destroy the current debit card in my possession as that card would be cancelled in the Regions system. Per Regions Bank, a new card would be sent to me and the fraudulent transactions would be flagged and investigated. I was instructed to stop by at a local Regions Bank branch to sign the requisite forms, including affidavits, verifying that the withdrawal was indeed a fraudulent transaction. As this happened on XXXX XXXX, the banks were closed. The very next morning ( Tuesday, XXXX/XXXX/15 ), I stopped by the XXXX branch in XXXX, LA to complete the forms. I checked in with Regions Bank on Friday morning, XXXX/XXXX/15 to inquire about the pending investigation. I was told that my claim was denied for a return of the stolen funds as this was an ATM withdrawal and, per Regions, the only way money could be withdrawn was with the use of my card and my pin. Additionally, as I was  in the area '' ( XXXX XXXX is not that big of a city ), my claim was denied. A notice would be mailed to me and arrive shortly explaining their denial of the claim. Their  investigation '' took less than 2 business days. I asked them to take a look at the ATM video footage of the withdrawal in question in order to verify the identity of the actual person who committed the crime. Per Regions, as this happened at a XXXX location, they can not review ATM footage unless the local police department conducts an investigation and receives the video footage ; to then hand over to Regions Bank. It was at that moment, days later, that the bank advised me to contact a police department and file a police report. Currently, this matter is being investigated by XXXX as the crime happened in XXXX XXXX, LA. I 'm filing this complaint for several reasons:1. Regions Bank advised me to contact the local police AFTER their investigation and claim denial. If a police report is a vital part of a bank 's fraud investigation, then the consumer and identity theft victim should be advised upon reporting a fraud.  2. Regions is apparently not up to date on current fraud techniques and, as such, can not provide adequate consumer protection.  3. I do not do business with XXXX. If Regions and XXXX allow account holders to access funds using each others ATMs, they should be able to exchange information regarding cases of fraud or other financial crimes.  4. Throughout the claim process, I was treated like the perpetrator, not the victim. I was told by several Regions associates ( names withheld ) that as the withdrawal was at an ATM, the individual accessing the funds had to have been me. I was told that as I was  in the area '', the fraud was most likely committed by me. The only way that I, the victim, can expect any level of consumer protection and restitution is to do the legwork of the bank : Providing data, contacting XXXX to request a release of the video footage to the police, and acting as an intermediary between the banks.

Shortly thereafter, another {$40000.00} was given to us from Hurricane XXXX, and the Bank also withheld that money pending repairs to our home. On XXXX XXXX, 2013, HSBC transferred their Mortgage Services to XXXX XXXX XXXX. They are holding appx {$52000.00} Flood Insurance Money in their Bank pending our signing a reconstruction contract with a builder, which has not yet occurred. When our {$52000.00} was transferred to XXXX, there were no written receipt sent to us attesting to the fact that they had that money in our account. I made numerous phone calls to XXXX XXXX, asking for something in writing to prove that our money, in that amount, was being held by them. After all, if their computers went down, how could we prove that they had our {$52000.00}. If I put XXXX cents into a savings account, I get a receipt. XXXX XXXX absolutely refused to provide us with a receipt on paper attesting to the fact that they were holding {$52000.00} of our money.  Also, they refused to say if they were paying us interest on that money. Apparently, there IS NO law in NY State requiring Banks to pay interest on Flood Insurance Money being held by Banks. WHY, I DO NOT KNOW. I AM SURE THE BANK IS MAKING MONEY ON OUR {$52000.00}. Any money they make on Our money is ours. I am sure they are investing that money, and keeping it.   I wrote recently to the New York State Department of Financial Services about these XXXX issues. They forwarded a complaint to XXXX XXXX. I received a letter from XXXX XXXX supposedly in answer to my complaint. They did put in writing, in that letter, that they were holding {$52000.00} of our Flood Insurance Money. So finally, the State Agency got that in writing for us after two years. However, XXXX XXXX stonewalled on the issue of interest due us on that money. They filled half of the letter with an answer to an issue that I did not raise, and that was the issue of them releasing our Flood Insurance Money to us. I did not ask them to release any funds yet. They made it appear that they were answering my complaint, but they answered a question that they made up, not my real question.  Finally, they did not address the issue of whether we were due interest, and if not, why. They stated this :  Additionally, we recognize XXXX XXXX 's and XXXX XXXX 's concerns over the interest earned on the escrow funds. With the final disbursement of the insurance funds, any interest earned will be released with the draw.  We realize that no interest has been paid on these escrow funds, because the bank would have issued us a XXXX form.  We believe this is not fair. There may be as many as XXXX homeowners in New York State with banks holding Flood Insurance funds. They are, we feel strongly, profiting from all of these funds which are not theirs. Why are the Banks allowed to cheat us in this way?   ",chen1296@purdue.edu,0

I went to the local Wells Fargo branch to see what could be done, but they would n't help because the I was not permitted to see the XXXX accounts.   I was scammed by XXXX XXXX XXXX if that is her name XXXX and XXXX Systems XXXX if that is truly the company name. I was told that I was hired as a buyer, but for the first few weeks I had to use my credit line to make purchases ... supposedly until the corporate credit card was ready for me.

The payments to my credit cards were recalled with stop payment orders, so that the payments I had made were canceled. My XXXX card alone could cost me {$50000.00} in XXXX purchases.   Wells Fargo enabled this kind of fraud by allowing the payments to be reversed long after they were approved. This gave the scammers a few weeks to build up my confidence, and then to hit me hard with massive reversals, all the while taking the value of the purchases I had made for them.

The mortgage was refinanced and I was not aware that the bank account would incur fees in the amount of {$25.00} at that point.

In fact, I never made any payment towards those fees ( which grew to {$75.00} in late charges ) because they agreed to waive them. Eventualky, the fees were credited and I assumed that their agreement to cancel the fees meant a full resolution had been reached. However, the process after they agreed to waive the fees took months. I called us bank month after month because the fee they promised to reverse was still on my statement.

5531,"This is a growing problem with electronic bill payment through banks and credit card companies. In the past, the representation was/is that an electronic payment started on a particular day would reach and be credited by the payee the next day. The electronic process is quick ; that it might take a day arises from the fact that payer must send, then payee must examine the  package '', i.e. XXXX separate electronic processes : sending is completed the day of sending, examination of package by payee is done the same day or the next day. Thus, sending should be complete on the day of payment, crediting should be done either that same day if payee is entitled to use the funds that day or by the next day if entitled to use them the next day. There is no reason for further delay, and banks accepting electronic payments must do so promptly. Recently, I have been charged late fees and interest by Bank of America and XXXX credit cards when evidence likely shows the sending was electronically done well before the due date, i.e. these credit card companies insist on crediting the day after so their computers can charge hefty late fees and interest. Meanwhile, the sending bank ( XXXX bill payment ) is now changing, without warning, its description of electronic bill payment to the effect that electronic payment will take 2 business days beyond the day of sending ( i.e. not counting the day of electronic sending ). This is not only unreasonable but collusion with other banks delaying crediting to charge late fees and interest. It is unreasonable because : Question  gt ; What is the sending bank doing on the day of sending electronically [ Note, these are recurring monthly payments, so the bank knows weeks in advance when to start ] if not sending an electronic package which arrives somewhere the same day? It should not take 2 extra business days for the receiving bank to examine the electronic package electronically. The one extra day allowed in the past is more than enough, and receiving banks should credit payment either the day of actual electronic receipt or actual availability of electronic funds which is the same day anyway [ just like a check is supposed to have sufficient funds when issued, an electronic payment should have sufficient funds also ]. The problems arose with electronic payments scheduled for a Friday with a credit card due date of Monday, with receiving bank ( Bank of America and XXXX credit cards ) crediting payment and charging late fee and interest on Tuesday. When informed of this development, XXXX now changes its representation that it would not be liable until 2 business days after, i.e. not counting the day of sending, this is collusion with the receiving banks. An electronic transaction started on Friday should not take til Tuesday. A receiving bank knows THE SUM TOTAL of the package on Friday and can use those funds on Friday even before it distributes fund into each separate account. There is no reason why it should not credit the separate accounts by Monday, even retroactively if necessary. Whereas XXXX was previously willing to inform the receiving banks that the electronic payment was started on Friday, now it says it has no duty to help for any due date until ( i.e. falling before ) Wednesday.

Since then, we have received an account statement showing that the account was still open and the monthly bank fee had indeed been charged so the account is now in a negative balance.

You are now chatting with XXXX : Thank you for chatting with me today. How can I help you?  XXXX : Hi, chatted a second ago about opting out of having a debit card transaction go through if there is not enough money in the account to cover the debit card transaction. You ( someone at Ally XXXX said there was no way to opt out of this and also no way to avoid a fee if using the debit card were to overdraft the account. Are you sure about this? My XXXX understanding of the law, from a webpage ( not a lawyer ) is this : XXXX : Remember to wear black XXXX XXXX, because that 's the day the infamous {$35.00} XXXX may finally meet its demise. From that day forward, a new Federal Reserve rule will prohibit banks from charging overdraft protection fees unless a customer opts in. Overdraft protection is a service offered by banks that allows checking account holders to temporarily make purchases with a debit card even if they do n't have sufficient funds in their account to cover them. In effect, the bank makes a shortterm loan to the account holder so his debit card is n't declined at the register or an ATM machine. In return, the bank charges an overdraft fee of {$10.00} to {$35.00}, according to an informal XXXX survey.  ( The new law ) puts the decision in the hands of the consumer as to whether they want overdraft protection for smalldollar transactions conducted by ATM and debit card, '' says XXXX XXXX, XXXX and XXXX 's senior economic analyst.

I wanted to check if indeed you give me the option to opt out of any overdraft ( as the website suggests is the law ) and how to do it.  XXXX XXXX : I 'm sorry for the delay.

I could not immediately close my old account since I had to first change my direct deposit information with Social Security and my pension fund. I did this, and I also changed all my information with my creditors.  In XXXX of 2015 I paid my monthly statement with a creditor in the amount of {$60.00}. I again checked to be certain they had the new account information. Approximately 10 days later, I received a letter from the creditor stating that they had received a returned payment communication from US Bank, and the payment was denied. I immediately contacted the same branch manager to see what the problem was. She told me there was no copy of any returned statement by them to the creditor since US Bank does not keep copies of returned payments on a closed account. However, the {$60.00} is missing from my new account.  Both the creditor and I believe that the new account was used for the payment. The branch manager insists that since she can not find a copy of a returned payment, the old account must have been used. I find no reason to believe the branch manager as the {$60.00} is still missing, and to whom did the bank release this money?   ",chen1296@purdue.edu,0

I had previously chosen to not have a purchase approved if funds were insufficient when the same thing happened a couple of years ago. I chose to have the purchase refused. My bank is USBank.

I stated that I specifically chose not to allow charges to be approved if my checking balance was insufficient. I also stated that an no time did I change my account to use the XXXX XXXX XXXX as a source to cover any overages. USBank charges {$12.00} to cover the purchase with the XXXX XXXX XXXX. This also means that since I have used funds from my XXXX XXXX XXXX, I am now being charged interest on the amount from the XXXX XXXX XXXX and need to make monthly payments to the XXXX XXXX XXXX until the balance of used funds is {$0.00}.

5698,"This is a growing problem with electronic bill payment through banks and credit cardcompanies. In the past, the representation was/is that an electronic payment started on a particular day would reach and be credited by the payee the next day. The electronic process is quick ; that it might take a day arises from the fact that payer must send, then payee must examine the  package '', i.e. XXXX separate electronic processes : sending is completed the day of sending, examination of package by payee is done the same day or the next day. Thus, sending should be complete on the day of payment, crediting should be done either that same day if payee is entitled to use the funds that day or by the next day if entitled to use them the next day. There is no reason for further delay, and banks accepting electronic payments must do so promptly. Recently, I have been charged latefees and interest by XXXX XXXX XXXX and XXXX credit cards when evidence likely shows the sending was electronically done well before the due date, i.e. these credit card companies insist on crediting the day after so their computers can charge hefty late fees and interest. Meanwhile, the sending bank ( Citibank bill payment ) is now changing, without warning, its description of electronic bill payment to the effect that electronic payment will take 2 business days beyond the day of sending ( i.e. not counting the day of electronic sending ). This is not only unreasonable but collusion with other banks delaying crediting to charge late fees and interest. It is unreasonable because : Question  gt ; What is the sending bank doing on the day of sending electronically [ Note, these are recurringmonthly payments, so the bank knows weeks in advance when to start ] if not sending an electronic package which arrives somewhere the same day? It should not take 2 extra business days for the receiving bank to examine the electronic package electronically. The one extra day allowed in the past is more than enough, and receiving banks should credit payment either the day of actual electronic receipt or actual availability of electronic funds which is the same day anyway [ just like a check is supposed to have sufficient funds when issued, an electronic payment should have sufficient funds also ]. The problems arose with electronic payments scheduled for a Friday with a credit carddue date of Monday, with receiving bank ( XXXX XXXX XXXX and XXXX credit cards ) crediting payment and charging late fee and interest on Tuesday. When informed of this development, Citibank now changes its representation that it would not be liable until 2 business days after, i.e. not counting the day of sending, this is collusion with the receiving banks. An electronic transaction started on Friday should not take til Tuesday. A receiving bank knows THE SUM TOTAL of the package on Friday and can use those funds on Friday even before it distributes fund into each separate account. There is no reason why it should not credit the separate accounts by Monday, even retroactively if necessary. Whereas Citibank was previously willing to inform the receiving banks that the electronic payment was started on Friday, now it says it has no duty to help for any due date until ( i.e. falling before ) Wednesday.

She did not apologize and she argued with me about the number being incorrect. She told me to come back in to the branch and she would re-fax the form and do a hard close on the account. I could not go to the branch today so she told me to contact the XXXX number again and the customer service bankers could close the account. I did that and while I was on the line with US Bank customer service XXXX contacted me again and told me that she spoke to the cashier that watched her fax the form and they XXXX agreed that the number she faxed it to was on the form so she was going to investigate further and get back to me. She is not taking responsibility for giving my banking information to a regular citizen and trying to put the blame on me for her error.   ",john1300@purdue.edu,0
5723,"This complaint is about the fees my bank charged for a wire transfer, not the transfer itself. I did some business with a company XXXX and they pay through wire transfer. I had the money wired to my SunTrust account. The remitting bank XXXX provided a receipt showing that they remitted {$9100.00} XXXX to SunTrust. When I received the deposit, {$30.00} XXXX was missing, but then SunTrust charged me {$15.00} separately for a  domestic '' wire transfer. SunTrust publishes an incoming international wire transfer fee of {$30.00}. When I questioned the double charge XXXX {$30.00} off the top and {$15.00} extra ), SunTrust said they did not charge the {$30.00}. After several emails and phone calls, someone looked at the trail and determined that the incoming wire transfer came through XXXX bank and SunTrust received {$9100.00}. My guess is that SunTrust uses XXXX to process their international wire transfers since they are not an international bank. The Swift code for SunTrust was used but it obviously went through XXXX first, which shaved the published {$30.00} fee off the transaction. My main concern is that in the process of receiving my money, {$30.00} disappeared and I have no receipt or explanation for it. The fact that I was charged {$15.00} for a  domestic '' wire transfer between the bank SunTrust uses for international transfers and SunTrust itself is double-dipping and criminal. These transactions should be transparent and all fees should be disclosed up front. I would have been fine giving SunTrust the published {$30.00} for the international wire transfer, but the fact that another bank ( that I am not a customer of ) got that and then I was charged {$15.00} for a domestic transfer is the issue. It 's dishonest and needs to be stopped.   ",john1300@purdue.edu,1

5731,This complaint will look like a duplicate but it is not because it addresses XXXX issues both unresolved : First U.S. Bank reported to XXXX sometime XX/XX/XXXX that I had an account closed for  Suspected Fraud '' I never before XX/XX/XXXX even had an account with XXXX Bank my initial complaint about this was met with an apology and the account being  removed '' by U.S. Bank and an offer to open an account with them. I took the offer and it did NOT work out see issue two. Now that the account I DID open with U.S. Bank has been closed I went to open a new checking account and learned that the fraudulent U.S. Bank report of  suspected fraud '' was never removed and is still on my XXXX and XXXX reports so they lied offered me an account hoping I wouldnt notice luckily for me I found out how bad they are and have now learned about the initial lie.   Issue TWO : more lies after lying to get me to open the account with them my card BRAND NEW CARD was compromised and I had to file a claim no big deal I have overdraft and they promise hey your car payment will go through if its attempted since we have a fraud investigation going through and any overdraft fee will be waived. Long long story short my account was closed and I now  owe '' them XXXX ALL OF WHICH is in overdraft fees that they promised would never happen I know they wont acually respond to the complaint with more than a dunned email and a deposit agreement. The verbal contract *recognized by law in arkansas with a witness lucky me i was on speakerphone at my desk and a co-worker overheard it* to waive ALLLLLLL fees related to the fraudulent activity and the promise that my car payment would go through was not kept that being just as valid as the deposit agreement invalidates the dunned response but U.S. Bank doesnt care as long as they get to do what they want they continually walk all over the consumer. I have an idea NO MORE BIG BANKS period all of them should be broken into small regional bank and have a regional headquarters and more oversight than ever before this kind of thing banks love to pull is a huge reason our banking system is broken.   You would think just to provide half-way decent customer service they would have fixed the issue solely because my card was compromised within the first month that doesnt promote a positive experience instead not even an apology and more fees than should even be legal and then they get to strong arm us into paying by reporting us to XXXX so they get their money they did NOTHING to earn returning a transaction does not cost money having a negative balance does NOT cost money its basically an excel column on a smart spreadsheet with a negative value that cost nothing. Had I overdrawn myself ( I actually revoked the overdraft protection when I reported my card stolen with the promise my car payment would be okay to go through and pay back after the investigation ) then I would pay the fees all of them. At most I owe XXXX fee I dont feel I should owe any because had the fraud not happened my direct deposit would have been moved to that account and no overdraft would have occured even if just the fees were removed my balance would be poisitive so XXXX?   ,zhao393@purdue.edu,1

But on XXXX XXXX, 2015 I checked my balance online and I noticed the deposit never made it to my account. By this point I did lose my receipt. I went back to the bank and asked one of the cashers to check my deposit and she said I had never deposited the {$5000.00}. When I asked to talk with their assistant manager she did not appear to give me any support to do so. She then said was going to check later and promised to call me but she never did. The next morning I sent my wife to give them my business card and tell the manger that I really needed her to call me. XXXX hours later the branch manager called me and said they looked in the system and could not find anything.

I have to write a check or money order to deposit funds into his account. 2 days ago I went to make a deposit into his account but did not have my checkbook so I requested to buy a money order to deposit the funds into his account. They refused to sell me a money order because I am not a Chase customer.  I had to go to a local store, buy the money order then return to the bank to make this deposit for him.

I understand rules  procedures are made to protect people from depositing cash to fund groups XXXX but to charge a non account holder {$8.00} to cash a check that is drawn by their bank is a penalty to the non account holder. This is an injustice to the American people at which this bank profits THOUSANDS of Dollars every day across the country victimizing non account holders who simply want to cash a check.

I had the money available in my savings account but the personal banker had not linked my accounts together like I assumed she had when she talked about it. She explained the opt in as overdraft protection instead of what it really was. She also did not give me a temporary card when opening my account so I had no access to my money until I came back from vacation even though she knew I would need it. She did not go over the steps needed for online banking and I was not able to make the changes to protect myself against fees such as linking accounts and setting up alerts which I thought she had already done for me since it was something that was discussed.

5849,"I am a Chase customer. I was very disappointed with Chase ' services twice. First was when I set up a payment on an auto insurance company ( XXXX ) on a specific date in which I am 100 % sure I will get enough funds on that day because it 's payday. When XXXX attempted to push thru the payment, the bank denied the payment. XXXX tried twice to get the payment but was denied by Chase, twice. I spoke to several Chase bank specialists and they were all saying that there are no trace of XXXX payment placed on that day. On the other hand, XXXX was claiming they attempted to get the payment twice on that day but was declined by Chase. I was caught in between and Chase did not help me resolve this issue, I ended up paying DMV a lapse of my insurance due to XXXX canceling my auto insurance. XXXX cancelled my insurance because Chase did not provide any proof that I have enough funds in that account. Although my bank statement shows that I did have the funds, but XXXX is not accepting it because they needed a letter head from Chase stating that it was a Bank error. Chase refused to help me with that. I was left unanswered with my confusion that time. A month later, I also have a tuition fee with a huge amount scheduled. I knew I did not have enough funds on the scheduled date and I did not have any opportunity to cancel the scheduled auto-payment since it was done online ( and no options were shown ). I was expecting that Chase would deny that payment since I did not have enough funds in bank, like what happened to the XXXX incident last month. To my surprise, my bank was overdrawn. The payment went thru. I did not understand what 's going on. I called chase again and they can not give me any answers. I had to undergo so many hassle just because of the same situation but with different solutions. Although Chase helped me to stop the payment made, they did not even apologize for this inconvenience. The second frustration i have for Chase was when they closed my account without giving me prior notice. They did not call nor email me with this matter. Today is Monday and also my payday, so I went to go shop for XXXX presents and was embarrassed by the counter upon paying because my debit card was declined. Ofcourse, I double checked my funds and I have {$400.00} available balance to spend. I called chase again and they were saying that my account was closed and they can not undo it because they needed my SSN verification. I opened my account about 5 years ago and they did not require my SSN. It 's very upsetting to return the gifts I was supposed to purchase because I was not informed about closed my checking account. When I spoke to the specialist, she was sarcastic and rude, as if she was annoyed by my inquiries. I totally did not understand why they have to close my account for that reason and without a notice. They said they mailed a notice but I did not receive any. And also, if my account was closed, why did my cheque was deposited to my account and why the teller in the Chase branch did not inform me about my closed account? My Chase mobile app is showing that my account is still active and I can still view my account activities and balance. There are no signs or ways that I can tell that my bank account was closed until I swiped my card. Imagine when I was at a restaurant and I had to pay the food I just ate. This is not fair. My complaint for chase is that they are not consistent and they are misleading their clients. They do not give proper information and notice. They do not provide good costumer services and they do not think of what the customer will feel or will go through because of their mistakes. I am not a happy camper here.

Specifically, in going through my records in order to better understand how I could resolve ongoing identity theft, I discovered that when applying for a bank account at Scottrade Bank, Scottrade Bank improperly handled a number of documents which had very personal information on them. The actions of Scottrade Bank not only broke from the current standards of data security but also broke Scottrade Bank 's internal policies regarding handling customer information.   Specifically, on or around XX/XX/2013 ( XXXX XXXX ), XXXX XXXX, a regional manager from Scottrade Bank offered to receive Scottrade Bank account application documents via email.

I was also told on this call that the account was not set up with Right of Survivorship which up to this point I had not been told in person or on the phone. Also they have now tied my hands to pay any unforeseen bills that come in. All of my parents other assets were controlled by their trust but because we had the understanding that this account was under my control there was no need to include this account in the trust or probate their will. We were utilizing this account for end of life expenses. BOA is telling me the only option I have to get this money released is to Probate their will just for this checking account. BOA for two months gave me incorrect information in the Bank and on the phone because I also called and verified if I needed to do anything with this account or did I have control of it and was told YES. The bank should allow any surviving accountholder to continue to use the account to transact business after the death of another accountholder. We have an executed will and an executed trust that defines all asset distributions for my parents estate that should be sufficient to release these funds. I took all the right steps to notify BOA and now am being penalized because of BOA 's misinformation.

Yesterday I looked at my account and it said I was {$33.00} overdrawn as a result of a XXXX purchase I am on installment payments for. I screenshot the page. This was around XXXX. TD 's policy is that you will not be charged a fee if you deposit the negative funds the day the transaction is made. I deposited {$40.00} in my account on XXXX/XXXX/15 and had a {$3.00} balance after the XXXX purchase posted. Sometime during the overnight of XXXX, TD bank went into my account and changed the transaction date to show that the XXXX purchase was presented for payment on XXXX, which is a banking holiday as no transactions post on Sundays. In my screenshot, you will clearly see that the {$40.00} deposit was made the same date of the XXXX transaction. This morning I checked my account saw that Gas was presented for payment and that I was {$8.00} overdrawn. When I checked my account at lunch time on XXXX before going to the bank, TD bank changed the date of that transaction and charged me a total of XXXX overdraft fees. I am certain that TD bank is changing the dates payments are posted during the overnight while bank customers are sleeping so that they can charge NSF fees. By my estimations, I have spend over {$1000.00} in 2015 for this reason alone.

The last of these was dinner at XXXX XXXX XXXX for XXXX at XXXX in the evening. When I got home, I checked my balance online and saw that all the XXXX transactions were pending, but I had miscalculated and the last XXXX would overdraw the account by {$18.00}. Wanting to avoid an overdraft fee, I called the bank to attempt to transfer funds into the account, this service was not available, I attempted to find a way to transfer funds into the account online from another bank account, this was not available, finally I drove to the TCF ATM machine that stands in the place they used to have our branch, and found that the TCF ATM does not take deposits. The nearest branch is XXXX miles from my home, by that point it is XXXX at night. The next morning on XXXX I drove to the bank branch XXXX miles away, and gave the teller {$20.00} to deposit into the account and asked the teller to close the account. She stated that she was unable to close the account due to a negative balance. She explained that there were overdraft fees on the account for transactions that were pending. We both agreed that it did n't make sense, but she said she was unable to reverse the charges without manager approval and that the manager was not there and would not be returning that day. Today ( XXXX ) I received a letter in the mail from TCF Bank stating that my account now overdrawn in the amount of {$250.00} as of XXXX/XXXX/15. I have not used the account since and after speaking to the customer service department, I have learned from them that there have been no transactions since those XXXX on XXXX/XXXX/15. They explained to me that each XXXX of those transactions has incurred an overdraft fee. They explained that at XXXX each day, the deposits made before XXXX are added to the account, then any transactions that are posted ( collected by the merchant ) before XXXX are subtracted from the balance and then any transactions that are pending which would be overdrafts are assessed the fee. When I asked them to explain to me specifically how each of my transactions incurred a fee, the customer service team lead named XXXX said  Ok, let me give you an example. If on Monday morning you had {$100.00} in your account and you make XXXX transactions of {$50.00} each and they are still pending on tuesday morning you make a transaction of {$100.00} your account will have a balance of - {$100.00}. '' When I asked XXXX how many overdraft fees would be assessed on the account, he answered,  XXXX. '' This is not how I interpret the policy of the bank. Perhaps I am not interpreting it correctly, however, even if it is the policy does allow TCF to charge me XXXX overdraft fees between business days ( after XXXX and before XXXX the next day ) on an {$18.00} overdraft, that spells fraud. Because of a previous complaint I made to the bank, they had explained to me that when a transaction is marked  pending '' it means that there was a request for authorization to withdraw funds. The explained to me that the transaction is n't marked  posted '' until the merchant makes request for payment, which sometimes takes days. Additionally, TCF customer service was unable to describe for me how exactly each transaction incurred an overdraft fee. Furthermore, my call was disconnected twice conveniently when it seemed they could not explain something important, like how they get away with charging me a fee when they have not even received a demand for payment from the merchant and why two weeks ago they held my transactions in a pending state for days without charging a fee and only charged a fee after they conveniently posted several transactions on the same day as another transaction came through that would cause all transactions to overdraw, but not those same type transactions incur a fee within hours of authorization.

I recall very clearly that they seconded that suggestion of stop payments and that they did in fact notice that was n't my original payment schedule and hence figured it was wrong due to the 4 days earlier payment of {$450.00}.

On Wed XXXX XXXX at approx XXXX in the XXXX I checked my bank account and noticed a pending overdraw in my XXXX account in the amount of {$27.00}. This is despite the fact that I have overdraft protection which should have covered the overdraft. Perhaps since it was a  pending '' overdraft it had n't kicked in.

The website I was using changed my flights around last minute and ordered me the complete wrong flight. I explained to the people at the airport, but they did n't speak XXXX. To what I understood, they canceled the airline ticket and refunded the money. A week later, I still had n't received a refund, so I contacted them by phone. There was such a communication barrier that we were n't able to understand each other very well.  On XXXX XXXX, I filed a claim with B of A claims department for the amount of {$160.00} - claim # XXXX. The reason for the claim was that I canceled the plane ticket due to an error on their website.  The claims person I spoke to ( BofA ) said that I needed to listen to a recording at the end of the call. This recording stated that if fraud had occurred, I would need to fill out the paperwork they send me and mail it back in, in order for the claim to be accepted.  After the recording was finished playing, I called back BofA and explained that the recording I had received said that I was going to receive documents for a fraud case via mail. I informed them of two things, 1 - this was not a fraud case, and 2 - the address on my account would not reach me to fill out the paperwork because the address was incorrect. The representative informed me that the previous representative had made a mistake. She stated, there was no paperwork required for my case, as it was not due to fraud. She informed me that I would not need to change the address unless I wanted to. She also had me listen to a new recording. The new recording said nothing about sending in paperwork.  So far : 1.

The recording informed me of no paperwork 4. Representative changed my address On XXXX XXXX the money was withdrawn from my account again. I called in and spoke to a representative that said I had not filled out the proper paperwork. I informed them of the previous conversations and they said that would not be a problem. I would just need to fill out the paperwork and fax it in. She simply emailed me the forms, I filled them out that exact moment and faxed them in. I do have a fax confirmation of this.  XXXX XXXX I called to check on the claim and get the status. The representative informed me that I am over due on the claim and that I lost the claim. I politely tried explaining that the fault is on BofA for screwing up the paperwork that was required, even though they said it was n't, and sending it to the wrong address, even after I changed it. I explained to her they they informed me I would not need to fill out any paperwork. They also informed me that the credits for the overdraft fees would be reassessed to me. I disputed this as there was another claim that was decided in my favor for the amount of {$970.00} which was the reason for the account going into overdraft.  I need BofA to apply to the credit for {$160.00} for the claim that should have been decided in my favor.

I also need BofA to credit me for the time its taken to handle this claim and set the account straight. This amount can be negotiated.   ",chen1296@purdue.edu,1

In XXXX XXXX at my own expense ( as instructed ) I flew from XXXX to XXXX to authorise an international fund transfer. Shortly after returning back to XXXX I called the local banking centre that set up and approved my funds transfer to release my funds. Only to be instructed that I would need to re-visit a local banking centre within XXXX and complete another set of fund transfer forms because of an internal error. The customer support helpline said that the only department that had the authority to resolve this error was the ( BOA ) resolution department. However it was there next statement that I found the most disturbing of all. I was told that the banks help desk has no means of contacting the resolution department and only way to receive a response was if I wrote to them. Please be mindful that I have already spent over {$2000.00} dollars on the previous round trip to get to a BOA branch and now the dollar to pound exchange rate had weaken significantly.  During the next 12-16 mths I made dozens of international phone calls to ( BOA ) requesting a quick resolution.

The fact was for each call made I was required to repeat the whole history of the case to each new advisor including the steps and measures that I have already taken thus far.

She left me in her office momentarily and when she returned she informed me that her manager XXXX XXXX XXXX ( senior vice president of customer market manager ) said he would personal investigate into this matter and contact me via email by Thursday XXXX XXXX. XXXX XXXX did not contact me so I revisited the bank.

I was also informed that the task of investigating my account management service  support failings has been assign to XXXX XXXX XXXX from the market leader escalation.

6125,"JP Morgan Private Bank has engaged in a series of petty, abusive harassments for years and has refused to provide basic banking services on our checking and savings accounts for as long. Furthermore, there is ample evidence that it is quite and consistently disingenuous in denying these allegations, much less, remedying them. It again engaged in such hostilities when I sought to get checks and an ATM card recently, neither of which I 've been able to obtain for years from it because of its perpetual harassments, deceptions, and denial of basic services that are suppose to obtain to our accounts and which we should be able to reasonably expect.  Earlier this week I went into a Chase bank, as part of the JPMorganChase, N.A. conglomerate, XXXX, and spoke to a XXXX XXXX XXXX in an effort to obtain personal checks and an ATM card. He was affable and seemingly helpful, and told me that I would have the new checks and a new ATM card by today, Friday, XXXX XXXX 2016.

Altogether, I waited at XXXX XXXX ' desk for about 30 minutes when I met with him. He said at the time that his computer was slow as an explanation for the time it took to process my routine requests.  The next day I was in the area again on other business and stopped in to see him in response to his telephone message. He was not available when I arrived so I waited for about 10-15 minutes, then had to leave without seeing him. Before I did so, I spoke to XXXX the tellers in this tiny bank and asked her to please tell XXXX XXXX that I 'd gotten his telephone message, had stopped in to see him, and to please call me with any additional questions but to indicate what they were if he had to leave a message again. I never heard from XXXX XXXX again prior to getting the new checks and ATM card.  Yesterday some checks and an ATM/debit card arrived. As usual, they were the wrong checks on the wrong bank and the ATM card appears to be on the wrong bank as well, although it is difficult to tell what bank it is on and where that bank may be located. I had brought samples of the checks we 'd needed more of with me when I 'd met with XXXX XXXX. He looked at them and kept them for some time before returning them.

6128,"My complaint is with Bank of America and their horrible service/help, or lack their of, for a valued customer of 8 years. The incident started last year, XXXX. Up until XXXX XXXX I was married to my ex-husband. We separated in XXXX XXXX. During our marriage there was a XXXX account under my ex-husbands name. My name was never on that account and he was never on any bank account of mine nor was he able to have access to my card whatsoever. During our marriage ( before XXXX XXXX ), I was given cash by my husband about 2 times to pay a XXXX bill with my card. My card was never set for automatic withdrawal, my card was never connected to the XXXX account nor was my name ever connected to it or on any account. In fact, there was no account or company that my ex-husband and I both were on with our names together. Around XXXX XXXX, I contacted XXXX because I saw they had automatically withdrawn money from my bank using my card and I specifically told them they were not allowed to do so and I never gave them the authorization to use my card without my consent. So at this point, they agreed to not use my card without my consent and also to take it off file. This is on record and can be heard through XXXX 's  supposed '' recording process (  for quality purposes '' ) they have when you call their customer service department where the associate agreed to take my card off file. On XXXX XXXX, XXXX, a charge of {$670.00} was applied to my card and the money was taken out of my bank account, per XXXX XXXX. As a battered ex-wife coming out of an abusive relationship and being the person to leave, I had every notion that my ex-husband had used my card ( which he had that information because he secretly saved it ). I had every notion that my ex-husband used my card to pay his XXXX XXXX bill. A charge for {$670.00} from XXXX XXXX is unheard of but it happened to me. I contacted XXXX XXXX numerous times, countless times, to fix the charge, they agreed they withdrew money using my card without my consent but refused to fix it. Now I contacted Bank of America with this concern and I filed a claim for fraud against my ex-husband and Direct TV. Bank of America gave me a temporary credit of {$670.00} for that charge, but failed to mention, when the claim was denied, the actions they were going to take. After 90 days ( XXXX XXXX ), Bank of America withdrew the {$670.00} from my bank account and reversed the temporary credit denying my claim of fraud. This put my account overdrawn. Bank of America said XXXX XXXX took the money out without my consent and my ex-husband did not. This was a surprise to me but either way, I was never contacted about money being withdrawn from my account. How I found out was an email the next day of notice that {$670.00} was taken out of my account and my account was overdrawn. Bank of America stated that XXXX XXXX has a contract where they automatically pay a due amount with any card previously used on file. I, in fact, told DTV to remove my card from the account around XXXX XXXX, as I stated ... apparently they did n't. I was never aware of this contract nor was I ever on the DTV account to know of this either. After the initial fraud claim, we refiled the claim as an unauthorized charge claim. BOA denied my second claim of an unauthorized charge, since they said my first claim of fraud was incorrect. Bank of America did not work with me, did not do anything in my favor. They did n't care my account went negative. They are complying with XXXX XXXX and going against my claim and a knowingly unauthorized charge. After numerous calls to BOA cust service, every representative agreed it was wrong of XXXX and they did it without my consent. But Bank of America does n't care to help their customers.

6158,"Before leaving for an extended stay in another country, I contacted Santander Bank to let them know that I would be in a certain city for 9 weeks and wanted to make sure that there would be no problem using my debit card at the Santander ATM in the city I would be staying in.

In XXXX 2016 ( mid-way through my stay ), Santander made a decision to de-activate my debit card as a new one, with a new chip, had been sent to my home and had been activated by the bank. I received no notice that the card I had with me would be de-activated. So, basically, Santander Bank is holding my funds hostage while I am in another country, unable to get the card that is sitting in a pile of mail at home. I have spoken with numerous representatives trying to get help and the answers have been the same ... so sorry ... .nothing we can do ... .the new cards were machine generated ... .the card you have with you can not be reactivated ( exp. date XX/XX/XXXX ) etc. I am trying to figure out a way to get cash. I can not believe that Santander activated a new card and deactivated the card I currently have with no notice or input from me. I thought it was up to the consumer to activate a new card. The fact that Santander is unwilling to even try to help me is unacceptable. I am sure that I am not the only consumer who has been left stranded without access to their funds while out of the country. How could this possible be legal???? Of course, I am closing my accounts with Santander upon my return home but I think more needs to be done to address this completely irresponsible decision.   ",zhan2016@purdue.edu,0

6198,"Citibank has attempted to defend its actions in this matter by reliance upon the Expedited Funds Availability Act. That defense is only tangential, not central, to the current claim.

As noted by XXXX XXXX, General Counsel for XXXX, in his email of XXXX XXXX, 2015 ( copy attached ), any bank teller with the requisite training in detecting counterfeit cashier 's checks should have immediately known that the check I presented for deposit was counterfeit.

'' In addition, as noted by XXXX XXXX, legitimate cashier 's checks bear the telephone number of the issuing institution ( which the counterfeit check did not ) and the check in question bore a suspicious  security features box located on the reverse side.

The woman then lifted the freeze on my card, and I was able to make an online purchase.   A few hours later, I go to use my card again. It is declined. I call the bank back and am hung up on in the middle of speaking to someone twice. I call back a third time. The woman is so rude to me regarding the charges that I tell her I will go to my local branch. I walk to my local branch ( XXXX ), and the manager there informs me my card has this time been canceled, confirms a new one has been ordered, confirms my address and I leave.   That was XXXX XXXX. Today is XXXX XXXX. After going to the bank numerous times and having the card sent to XXXX separate addresses, I have still not received a debit card. I have not had a debit card for my account for 43 days.   I have already filled out a survey explaining all of this following my calls with the customer service center. No one ever called me. I have never been contacted regarding my issues, despite numerous phone calls and visits to my local branch. The service I have received, particularly being a new customer, is borderline unbelievable.   At this time, I have gone on my online banking on my own and ordered a new card, and put in a THIRD address, hoping it would come there. To be very clear, both my home and the additional address I used ( work ) are extremely secure, so neither of these are instances of mail disappearing. They simply never arrived. 43 days later, I 'm ordering my own card, having never been contacted by customer service and still without a card, which I 'll spend another week waiting for, hoping it will arrive.

6336,"On XXXX XXXX, I attempted to withdraw money from my M  T checking account using my debit card, and the ATM told me I was n't able to due the balance in my account. I immediately went into the XXXX, XXXX branch to review the transactions, and I identified XXXX fraudulent ATM withdrawals : {$500.00} on XXXX/XXXX/16, {$400.00} on XXXX/XXXX/16, and {$100.00} XXXX/XXXX/16. That same day at the bank, I submitted a card dispute indicating that the card was in my possession at the time of the withdrawals, but the withdrawals were not made by me.   The day after I submitted the card dispute, I returned to the XXXX, XXXX branch of M  T and provided a time card receipt from my employer showing I was clocked into work in XXXX, XXXX at XXXX XXXX ET on XXXX, which was only XXXX minutes after the fraudulent withdrawal for {$500.00} was made in XXXX, XXXX at XXXX XXXX ET, as shown on my bank statement. It takes over a half hour to get from XXXX to XXXX, so the time clock audit I tried to provide the bank from my workplace, shows that I could n't have made the withdrawal at the XXXX, XXXX location. When I attempted to provide this documentation to the Associate at the XXXX branch, the Associate helping me was not interested in reviewing this documentation, and I do not believe it was submitted as part of my dispute.   I have returned multiple times since then trying to provide this documentation and understand why my dispute was n't going anywhere, and none of the people I spoke with at the bank assisted me with submitting the documentation for my dispute. Each time I visited, no one seemed to know what was going on. I also had to ask the bank whether they had shut my card off, and the Associate I was dealing with said she did not know.   While M  T initially gave me credits for the disputed withdrawals, I found out that they ended up reversing the credits, which took my account balance below {$0.00}. When I asked to see documentation, the teller at the bank did not provide documentation, but only said the claim was difficult to investigate because the fraudster got my card PIN right on the first try for each withdrawal attempted.   I have not received any communications regarding my dispute from M  T. Each time, I 've had to visit the branch to find out what 's going on and why I do n't have my money back from these fraudulent transactions. My mother, who is the secondary holder on the account ( and who lives in XXXX ), informed me that she received a letter in the mail saying my dispute had been denied due to lack of documentation, but I attempted to provide documentation and the bank did n't take it. Furthermore, any communication about this dispute should not have been sent to her, it should have been sent to me, as she is the secondary holder on the account, and not the cardholder for the disputed transactions.   I went back to the XXXX, XXXX branch 2 weeks ago to re-submit the dispute, but I have yet to hear anything back about the new dispute I opened. Furthermore, due to the credits being reversed from my previous dispute closed by the bank, my account was overdrafted and I have now been charged {$77.00} by the bank in overdraft fees.   I 'm filing a complaint with the CFPB, because I have visited the M  T branch 2-3 times a week since this started trying to get this issue resolved, and have still not been able to. I feel that the bank has not investigated my claim properly, followed the correct procedures, or been able to provide me with the documentation about my dispute that I requested.

Before I proceeded I asked am I being charged for the call and the representative confirmed that I was not since it was the first call of the month. After I explained why I was calling she apologized and stated that she needed to transfer the call to online banking. XXXX answered the call I confirmed with her if I would be charged for the call she said if she answer my question then yes I would be charged. I said well that is OK I will not present the question because I do not want to be charged. She said that she would waive the fee.

What ever the reason is they did not answer my question and besides this being that I have an account there I should be able to ask questions without the threat of having fees to pay to receive answers. I sent them a email and here is what I said : I had a question about my transfer that I performed several days ago. I know that it says that it could take up to 3 days however since it was done late last week I thought today being Wednesday that it would be there by now. I have not called or spoke with anyone in XXXX 3 months and now today I simply called in to ask about my transfer and the representative confirmed that I would not get charged for the call.

Before I asked her a question I wanted to confirm if I were being charged and she said if she answer my question then yes I was going to get charged I then proceeded to say please do not answer my question because I do not want to be charged.

A few days later on XX/XX/XXXX I went to the ATM on XXXX XXXX in front of XXXX XXXX XXXX to get money out to give my son to pay our rent. My wife went with me because I was worried the machine might eat my card again. When we went to do the transaction we noticed that there were only {$54.00} in the account, when there should have been {$350.00} in the account, or a little more. I had just transferred {$70.00} to my father in law online in the morning. My wife said  Maybe it 's a math error and the account has n't caught up to itself '' so she tried to take out {$300.00} anyway. When she did a screen popped up that said  You will be subject to overdraft fees if you continue ''. We knew then that there was a problem. So we hit cancel on that screen and removed the temporary card. We then went down to the branch on XXXX XXXX in front of the University XXXX XXXX XXXX and no one could help. They said we had to wait until after midnight and to call customer service. As my wife and I were looking over our account activity, we realized that the transaction for the {$300.00} that was missing from the account took place at XXXX at that ATM with a different debit card than the temporary one that I had. My original card ended in XXXX, the temporary ended in XXXX and the one that took the money fraudulently ended in XXXX. I had never been to that ATM before, and I am well aware that I am only allowed to take out {$300.00} per day. I would not go back to the ATM and try to take it out twice.  We called customer service and the young man we finally spoke to immediately cancelled the card ending in XXXX. He assured me that they would credit my account the next business day or so. They did n't, so I called back again and they tried at that time to say that it was me who took the money. I told them clearly that I did not. They filed an investigation and gave me a {$300.00} provisional credit. Some days later I received an email saying that they had finished their investigation and were sending me a letter. The letter came a few days later and simply said  We have concluded our investigation and have found that the transaction was made by you or someone who had your permission ''.  Why would I take three days out of my life and file a fraud investigation request if I knew that I was the one who had taken the money out? Someone else used the card with the fraudulent number or there is something wrong at the bank. They never said how they investigated it, why there was another ATM card issued on the account. I had never had any trouble with my account since I opened it.. I did NOT get any money out of that ATM on XXXX XXXX, in front of XXXX XXXX XXXX, I had never been there before that day. Whomever took that money was there at XXXX. according to the information in my account. The only reason I went there is because I did n't want to go back to ATM that ate my original card.

The fees they charged caused the account to go into the negative. that is the only thing that caused the account to go negative. I fought that and got most ( but not all ) of the charges reversed. The 2nd item involved TD Bank clearing unauthorized charges against a business account which put the account into the negative and then charging fees for being overdrawn which made the negative balance larger. I was unsuccessful in fighting TD on reversing these charges and had to deposit {$65.00} to bring the balance to XXXX. At this point I closed the account to stop the madness.

I also informed XXXX that I was working with a credit repair company to get my credit scores fixed, but I needed to know the parameters US Bank used to approve or deny credit. XXXX said that US Bank did not deny loans based on the credit score, but used various factors to do so. Again, I asked what the factors are. XXXX 's answers became more ambiguous. He began to draw circles on the desk with his hands saying that the factors could be a number of things but stating nothing specifically only that the FICO credit score was not the main issue.

I then processed to tell him, that you just came in here and did n't discuss anything with us and now your telling me all I have to do is open a new account.

6470,"I received an offer from Citibank to open a new Citigold bank account in XXXX XXXX, which promised XXXX XXXX XXXX miles in exchange for making two ( 2 ) bill payments in consecutive months and for spending {$1000.00} on my debit card.   I met these requirements in XXXX XXXX and received a confirmation message on XXXX/XXXX/XXXX ( see attachment titled  Citigold Account Bonus Confirmation '' ) that the XXXX AA miles would post to my account on XXXX/XXXX/XXXX. I then patiently waited and paid the monthly fees associated with the account.

The promised XXXX/XXXX/XXXX date came and passed.   After opening a series of investigations with Citi, they have repeatedly denied giving the me bonus that I am due in association with this account ( see one such denial in attachment titled  Citibank Letter 2 '' ). I have since read many, many accounts online of this same scenario happening with many, many other Citibank customers. Citi is likely counting on these customers not fighting back on this, but it is time someone like me takes a stand on this.   Citibank is systematically and fraudulently baiting consumers into signing up for Citigold accounts with the promise of this bonus, only to pull the rug out from under its customers at the last minute after collecting their fees.

6475,"I have recently been the victim of a series of fraudulent charges, all in relatively small amounts between $ XXXX-XXXX, over the course of the months from XX/XX/XXXX - XX/XX/XXXX. I became aware of these charges on XX/XX/XXXX, after the criminals had slowly drained my business account of over {$6000.00}.   When I finally realized what had been happening, I reported it immediately to my financial institution, Chase, at my local branch in XXXX XXXX, CA on XXXX XXXX. They could see quite clearly that the charges were fraudulent and expected the funds to be returned in a couple days.   On XXXX XXXX, I received an email that {$3900.00} would be transferred into my account ( already far short of the approximately {$6500.00} due ). Later that day I received notice that my claim was denied. I have escalated this to the extent of my ability and have received nothing positive whatsoever. Chase is telling me directly that their refusal to refund is my responsibility, as I should 've reported far earlier - this of course, dependent on knowing what happened, and I did n't.   A bit more explanation : The charges were all from a XXXX station in XXXX, CA - a place I 've never been. I do, however, buy gas, etc ... at XXXX in XXXX XXXX, so if I see  XXXX - {$65.00} '' on a statement, I do n't think anything of it. Simply not an odd charge.   Chase has informed me that my claim is invalid because the original charges were more than 35 days prior to me reporting them, which they claim is backed up by federal regulations that were in effect 9 years ago when I opened the account, something I doubt very much.   They also claim that because I accessed my account online via the QuickPay app on my phone, that I must have NECESSARILY seen these charges and just neglected to report them, something that defies all reason. I use that app to quickly pay my rent and my doctor.   Chase fully encourages the use of mobile banking, making it exceedingly easy to miss individual charges like I did. Chase also encourages electronic statements available online. I do n't receive my statement in the mail, nor do I receive it in email. An email that states it 's  available to view '' is n't the same as having the text in your face.   Yet they are adamant that even though they 've found multiple ways to discourage their customers from actually tracking their transactions, it 's still the customer 's fault to do so - in the course of our conversations they 've even said that fraud must be reported in 24 hours in some cases. Who lives their lives like this?   As it stands now, they are telling me they ca n't return a huge amount of money ( to me ) because of when the undeniably fraudulent activity began longer than 35 days prior to my reporting, and they imply that I was somehow complicit in it by 'knowing ' and not reporting it. They also tell me that even the charges within the 35 days prior to my reporting are denied.   All of this is premised on the idea that the funds are unrecoverable. That is clearly contradictory.. If they have 35 days, they could 've recovered at least those funds. They chose not to act at all for 31 days. Also, since all of the fraud was of the same variety and from the same source, if they 're able to track and recover the most recent charges, they certainly should be well within legal reasoning to recover the rest. Instead they 're completely obstinate in the face of a customer complaint.   I 've been a Chase business customer for 9 years. I 've had them alert me of fraudulent charges in the past, and I 've also noticed some myself and have had to report them. They 've left my account exposed repeatedly.   Their ONLY job is to protect my money and provide the services I need. They 've done neither, and in turn they 've blamed it on me.   They also refuse to accept any holes in their fraud detection system. ",mspanier@purdue.edu,1

His manager was in the room already and he turned and asked me if i wanted the {$100.00} bands or the {$1000.00} bands I stated the XXXX dollar ones and I needed about XXXX of them what ever they were willing to spare. He then turned back around in the room and got the straps came back to directly infront of me set the money down without placing it though a money counting machine.

I counted again and I got the same balance {$1400.00}. I proceeded to call the bank and speak to a woman who claimed to be a manager named XXXX she said she was balance his drawer and give me a call back. She called me back about 6 minutes later and said that his drawer was balanced correctly. I advised to her about him walking away with my money in his hands and not recounting it infront of me again. She stated that I should have counted it out when I was given it. I advised to her I wanted the cameras checked from his entire day touching funds. This money was never out of my possession. It was in a self sealing bank envelope and I never placed my purse anywhere but on the side of my body its a crossbody. I called this morning to speak to the bank manager his name is XXXX. I advised him on the situation at hand and that I needed someone to check his entire time with his register that day. I advised that when I spoke to XXXX yesterday she stated that she had eyes on him the entire time. I said how is this possible when if I remember correctly you were already in the room with your back turned? I asked her to please check the cameras and told XXXX the branch manager this. He stated to me he couldnt see how this was possible and didnt offer much assistance. XXXX had even stated I do n't know if we can pull cameras for this????? That is extremely alarming! What if they got robbed would there be cameras then???  This could have only been XXXX of XXXX things.  1. Accident and he counted {$100.00} too much to another customer.  2. Bills stuck together when counting out an amount to another customer resulting in a balanced drawer.  3. Theft. He took it either during my transaction or it was taken during his shift sometime and the cameras need to address his entire shift from start to finish.  I feel like I was stolen from point blank and I want to get down to the bottom of where this missing {$100.00} is. It can not simply vanish into thin air. I did not place my bag down at all. Nor did anyone have access to it whatsoever. All of my other checks I cashed balanced perfectly.

Several disputed unauthorized fee 's and service charges that were removed from my Bank Account still have not been returned to me as of today XXXX/XXXX/XXXX.

In XXXX, I attempted to get a loan modification through Bank of America. State of MD posted that modifications were available even if you were n't behind but anticipated problems. I was on time for my payment for both mortgages, but my wife lost her job. We asked for a loan modification for over a year, with no response. I contacted the bank 's military line and they finally responded and stated that they could not do a loan mod unless I went into the forbearance program. Entered the program and when my wife got a job I asked for the loan modification. POC confirmed they had all the information needed and asked us to wait. We waited and were told we were not approved because we were missing information. Of course, the POC no longer worked there. This went on for over a year, including work with a local liaison that worked for the county to work with the banks on load modifications. We applied again and again. After about 18 months we were told that we technically qualified for the loan modification based on the requirements, but the owner of the loan did n't want to modify. Mind you, I applied for this loan via Bank of America via my local branch. Bank of America, never communicated that they did not own the loan. I complained and in XXXX XXXX, I received a check for about XXXX from the Bank stating that they had not properly served me as a customer.

However, the debit card does not. They have you wait - in my checking account is my payroll money for bills, food, utilities, etc. I ca n't wait for that money to come back - that is my spending money and bill paying money. This has been a travesty - I just want unauthorized charges to stop. ",lo31@purdue.edu,0
6532,"My mother recently passed away. I have spent the last few weeks tending to her affairs and paying off any debt. She managed her finances well, and wanted to honor her memory by being thorough. One set of accounts at wells Fargo, was a checking ( we had joint as I provided her funds monthly ), savings, and a IRA. She had left me beneficiary on the Checking and IRA but she was apparently not aware she needed to do anything for the savings. We are both immigrants, I grow up in the US. We have no other family. So she was not very familiar with all the administrative things all ways needed. Her Savings account was the large liquid account I was using to pay her debt off and close her business licenses, etc.   Before death, she gave me a Durable Power of Attorney for Financial, Property, and Healthcare. Upon receiving her Death Certificate I notified Wells Fargo. However, the following events occurred which I feel Wells Fargo failed to provide adequate disclosures and did not act in the best interest of its customers.   1. When I notified the phone rep of the death, he put a block on all her accounts, even though I was listed as beneficiary and I identified myself. He did not disclose the block. This almost caused some issues with her debt payments.  2. When I went to the branch to show the Death Certificate, my ID, the Power of Attorney, they created a new checking account and transferred the checking account funds. I was not notified of this. Again, another failure of disclosure. I wanted to keep the old account as my mom has had it since I was a child going back to XXXX XXXX in XXXX. It was something I wanted to maintain to remember her. Wells robbed me of that. I figure that they would have to clearly notify me of this rather than doing it behind a terminal without communication.  3. Even though I am beneficiary on all her other accounts, she missed one account setup and have to go through probate despite having Power of Attorney during her life and beneficiary for all else. Regardless, I feel Wells Fargo is doing a disservice here. There is a huge population of baby boomers. I assume many do n't have every beneficiary field filled out. Wells could easily do data mining for empty fields for all depositors and as a courtesy, prompt them on login to update. This problem could have been solved beforehand. I assume there are going to be tens of thousands, if not millions of other families that have a similar situation or will upon a lived ones death. I feel banks could do more here to make sure transition is easier for the loved ones so they can focus on grieving vs the bureaucracy and pain Wells is putting my family through. I am paying off her remaining items on my own, which is fine. The funds will be released upon the judges signature, but the issue could have been avoided had Wells had more thoughtful proactive risk practices given its clients missing data fields. A simple query could easily ID other depositors with the same issue. So much frustration could be saved.  4. Given our aging population, seems there should be more uniformity of federal banking requirements on how to deal with beneficiaries. Having done this not, seems like its all over the place. Some banks do beneficiaries online, others only Trusts, or you have to go to a branch. It is not uniform. Some banks are easier, others are near impossible to deal with. A uniform requirement would make things easier for the living loved ones. ",apozivil@purdue.edu,0

6541,"My checking account was charged fees of XXXX for XXXX overdraft for 7 business day ( 9 calendar days ). On XXXX my checking was assessed an overdraft fee of XXXX for a check presented against my account ( XXXX ) for {$200.00}. My balance was XXXX after submittal. I received no notice in the mail on this item and was assessed XXXX sustained overdraft fees during this period. The first was on XXXX and the second sustained overdraft fee on XXXX both for {$30.00}. I understand the initial overdraft fee being assessed of XXXX. However, I find the sustained overdraft fees to be abusive and predatory in nature. Not long ago, sustained overdraft fees were generally applied after 10 business days. This time of 10 days allowed for the notification time that may occur for when a client may not be aware of this event. In my case, XXXX were applied before 10 calendar days occurred. Out of curiosity, I used an interest rate calculator to determine what this interest rate might be if I were to convert this small matter to a loan situation and I was told that the calculator could not estimate the rate because it was too large. So I adjusted the amount I was negative to XXXX ( but in reality XXXX ) against the total amount I would pay to rectify the matter of XXXX and the interest rate amounted to 192 %, which I believe is above predatory. I feel that 1 ) this matter is very abusive, borderline criminal. 2 ) the policy does not allow for sufficient communication time to allow for rectification IF it was determined that the abusive extra charges should be allowed to continue. Again, I do not believe Citizens bank should be allowed to pile on these types of fees with this level of ferocity. I do understand that Citizens bank is a business and that profit is their motive but this policy and practice is a pure money grab with little or no notification to it valued client/fellow citizen.

When the XXXX bank refused, as they were instructed by XXXX XXXX to refer the call to their Home Office, the Fraud department place a hold on our account for seven business days.  After XXXX hours of customer service, fraud, and local branch phone calls, we were told the branch manager of our home branch had the power and discretion to release the funds.

We had the XXXX XXXX Home Office manager in charge of clearing checks, XXXX XXXX, XXXX, talk to the local branch teller, XXXX and branch manager, XXXX, XXXX, to verify the funds. The XXXX bank called them as well.  The branch manager, XXXX, told us she would not release the funds, even after the money was received from the issuing bank due to bank fraud concerns.  In the meantime, our account remains suspended. The branch manager claims their action is for our own protection and their against fraud. We are new to their bank, less than a year, but the excuses we received make me shake my head in wonder. Because we are newer accountholders, and the size of the check is larger than previously deposited, and the fraud department made the security determination, they would not accept the assurances of the other bank, the insurance company or us that this was not a fraudulent transaction and used the protocol of holding funds to shield their actual discretion.  Amoung the numerous calls we made and the in person experience at the XXXX branch, we were told the funds would be released on the XXXX, XXXX and then XXXX. They are sticking with the XXXX.  US Bank is holding our funds hostage to prevent the purchase of the replacement car, groceries, and whatever else we might need for the principle of fraud protection.  I own a home, I have my XXXX children, and my wife has her XXXX children. We are both employed. We previously transacted our banking with a credit union. The replacement vehicle is essential to our health, well being and employment. The implication of their anti-fraud effort is insulting and unnecessary. They obviously do n't want our business, but they also need to release these funds. XXXX XXXX already released the funds so they can not replace the check issued for this deposit.

As basic as I can put it, what criteria specifically allowed my Reserve Line to stay open during XX/XX/XXXX-XX/XX/XXXX 's periodic reviews of creditworthiness compared to now? I 've the received the notice from US Bank about this decision to close my Reserve Line, but none of the reasons stated for this closure are true. Again, during XX/XX/XXXX-XX/XX/XXXX my credit score dropped to a XXXX, I had no other available credit,  I was consistently maxed out on my Reserve Line usage,  every payment I owed was over 90 days late or being charged off. In the past year my debt to income ratio has improved, my available credit has increased,  my credit score has increased over XXXX points,  all payments are on time. Suddenly my Reserve Line is deceptively closed when I 'm no longer using it,  with false reasons stated for the closure. US Bank can not clarify why this happened or explain the justification behind this decision in comparison to the decision to leave it open for the previous 5 years when I was an admittedly horrible candidate for credit.

I think it 's unreasonable for Citi to expect me to keep mail for such a period, especially after confirming my offer eligibility. I believe Citi intentionally misled me in a way that encouraged me to pay monthly fees for as long as possible. I searched the internet for others with similar issues and was not surprised to find that the issue appears to be widespread. I believe the evidence points to numerous instances of intentionally deceptive marketing practices by Citi.

I asked him to bring his supervisor into the conversation so that I could  opt out '' of this requirement. I explained that a bank account had the customer 's personal and private identifying information along with confidential financial information.

Due to the possiblity of a counter lawsuit i have been avised by an obtain legal representative to refrain and omit my previous complaint of fraud and criminal acts of using funds to pay recently Parted Ebay without some type of document stating that this act was implemented. Please also note copies of corresponding oral dialog were also discovered ( an app that rec all conversations and msg and stores via cloud ) unknowingly to both parties ( paypal rep and I ) stating and unknowing contridicting previous Paypal representive Statements on company policy and reasons excuses.

Im not too familiar but isnt it unortdox and unethical proceedure to take actions on client ( I ) based on issues relations with other ( recently parted ) party. Its basiclly giving and saying i dont like you and i can keep your funds till i feel that you have acted properly to release it to you. but noting and stating that due to late shipments to buyer ( my customer ) that they have adopted this new policy... Also would like to include that i am being penalized with fees by Paypal for their own policy.  3. Paypal proceedure on charging a fee on all transactions after the initial fee. Including refunds to customers from disputes and double charges to same clients do the fact that once a complaint has been made by buyer paypal has the attority to release funds and make a desesion on faulty party ... without checking validity of statements. Basically, making judgement without facts and purely base on its views ( i assume not based on facts ) on client ( i ) previous issues. In stead of a etically position of making a finding of judgement on fault based on present complaint.  4. paypal policy on advising the client ( i ) to recharge the buyer after it has made a mistake on judgement. and stating that they do not have the authority to retract the erroneous judgment. I am not sure on this act if it is a criminal act or an ethical concern and wasnt counceled on it with attorney but taking my chances and making this statement because i do have the email corresconding dialog with client buyer on it ... in additon also being charged a fee for this XXXX transaction.

6752,"HSBC froze funds and closed checking and credit card accounts without giving reason and without allowing the opportunity for any defense.  We suspect the only reason is that the account holder is a XXXX national.  The account holder is a retired XXXX window who lives in XXXX. The checking account has been open for more than 10 years and the activity on the account has not changed since. The source of the funds have also remained unchanged, the account is funded with regular check deposits from passive rental income. The real property which is the source of the income is located within the US and has been owned by the account holder for 40 years, and it was purchased when the account holder was a permanent US resident, with income generated from employment in the US.  The problems started when suspicious calls were made by someone who purported to be from HSBC to the account holder 's residence in XXXX, so we inquired by sending an online banking  bank mail '' message and HSBC responded that there were no records of HSBC having made calls, so we assumed they were fraudulent calls. Later we received a letter sent to the US mailing address, stating that we needed to call a number to provide missing information before a certain date. No mention of what information was being requested was provided. We made the call in a timely manner but were told by HSBC that we had to provide the unspecified information in person, at a specific HSBC branch, ( which was not near our US address nor was it the branch where the account was opened ). The deadline was not extended regardless that we explained that the account holder resided abroad. The funds were frozen and online banking access blocked. The account holder was able to fly to the US and go the indicated HSBC branch a couple days after the deadline. She brought with us passports, bank statements and proof of the source of the income. We were told by a XXXX XXXX, a Bank manager at the HSBC Branch on XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX, NY, that  they '' may not accept the information and documents we were showing her. But she would not tell us who  they '' were or precisely what information was required. All we knew is that because the account was from a XXXX national,  they '' needed the source of funds information. We were, however, able to draw an HSBC cashiers check with most of the funds, and decided to take out business elsewhere. We were also told that we could continue using an HSBC credit card which they said had nothing to do with the checking account. Today, notwithstanding, we received a letter informing us that the credit account was being closed because we allegedly failed to provide the information they requested, and online banking is blocked so we can not even pay the balance on the account and will likely incur interests for late payment.  We vehemently deny having failed to provide information. We, in fact, provided information regardless of never having been clearly told what information was required or why it was being requested. The only thing we were told was that banking has changed now a days. I understand that HSBC has been involved in international money laundering. But we are not criminals, all funds are traceable to a legitimate source. Unfortunately, it appears that simply for being XXXX, lawful funds were withheld, credit ratings may be harmed, and the accounts were closed. All, for no good reason. The fear of loosing the funds she depends on have caused significant troubles and distress to the innocent account holder, who happens to be my mother and I am a US Citizen. I am also an NY XXXX and am able to understand how regulations work, so I can confidently say that HSBC appears to be acting unfairly and, perhaps, unlawfully. And my research shows that my mother is not the only one being treated this way. I trust CFPB will help end this discriminatory treatment. ",bbrumfi@purdue.edu,0

Before these issues, my life, my credit, my career and my identity where not only going very well, but we can prove, we never missed a bill EVER. We can also show faxes, witnesses, police reports, emails, phone records right on down the line and the fact we never were once late with a credit card bill, ever, we always paid more than was expected. So how come if we always paid on time and kept up with other monthly bills did USAA put our credit card in collections when we sent them identity theft paperwork on the credit card and checking account. Falsely putting credit card in collections itself has cost us major health, job, credit issues we never ever had as well as a whole breed of fake things on your credit. The headaches alone we go through daily and the loss in our lives is extreme. Not to mention the dozen of unpaid policy renters and automobile things need to be paid. But even from the first issue when we were massively identity theft through our checking, even though we ended up finding out who it was and there was an arrest and witness to came to us and testified to the culprit wrong doings, the whole time we had money missing from our accounts prior to finding out what was going on USAA BANK was rude and uncaring and told me that it was probably my boyfriend at the time doing it and I should have him arrested. WHAT KINDA COMMENT IS THAT. And after we found out who did it, when we called to let USAA BANK know XXXX ( ext XXXX ) screamed at XXXX XXXX when he was trying to be kind and let them know what was going on, she did not care, she was more concerned if we wanted anything from them. This is something we dealt with everyone from USAA, all my life I never seen any COMPANY get away with so much.

When we asked why, they refused to tell us and they held on to our money for over a month. And when they do give you an answer its some generic response, WE INVESTIGATED AND FOUND THAT COMPANY ACTED IN ITS BEST INTEREST. Ok, first off, they whip they out and use it for an excuse to get away with crime. I believe companies like USAA BANK that get away with as many issues unresolved as ours and caused not only a major shift, but major health issues, career issues, life issues, identity theft issues, I can go on all day, but USAA BANK does n't care, they do n't. Before this, I never had XXXX these issues in my life, now I deal with it 5 hours a day or more. When a company like USAA BANK gets away with this much, this long, and do n't have to answer to anyone, they breed identity thieves, cause then the thieves think they can get away with it cause USAA BANK not only does but has time and time and time and time again. I ca n't write all the issues here, not enough space. This is a fire engine red alert, this is past time to be fixed, and there are health, life and other issues here.

XXXX was for {$25.00}, and XXXX for {$46.00}. On XXXX XXXX they were in the pending column and I had over {$800.00} in my account. More than enough to cover them! That evening, my landlord deposited my rent check for {$1400.00}. This was after the XXXX XXXX XXXX charges! I was charged for XXXX overdraft charges instead of just XXXX. The {$1400.00} check caused the overdraw, not the XXXX XXXX XXXX charges. This is not fair!! how do these people do their accounting!

I told them I am always grateful, as they pay about 95 % of my overdraws, but when it is not warranted ( as in this case ) I do not want to pay overdraft fees. They would not help me because they said they have already returned fees to me. This bank has returned fees to me due to the fact that they should have not taken them! I often do not say a word to them when I feel the charge is warranted. These charges are not. I have complained to this agency before about them. Why is something not done? This is just another form of  high to low '' checking that they use to collect fees.  A few weeks ago they charged me XXXX overdraft fees, and then {$12.00} to transfer money from my way to save account ( the transfer was for {$5.00}, and they charged {$12.00} for this!! ). I am sick of this type of thing. Since when does it cost a bank {$12.00} to transfer someones ' money??? I do n't even think they are allowed to charge more than XXXX fees in one day, so they waited till the next day to post the {$12.00} fee, even though the money transfer was on the same day as the XXXX overdraft fees. I want that {$12.00} returned to me, as well as the {$70.00} in overdraft fees that were unwarranted from XXXX/XXXX/16. I am a XXXX XXXX XXXX woman who is supporting her XXXX XXXX XXXX mother, and paying for a caregiver out of my own pocket!! That is why I overdraw! I have been with this bank for over 9 years.

Pls see below in Italics complaint from the internet about their re-ordering of transactions.   try not to have an overdraft but it happens. On a Friday I made XXXX debit transactions at store. On Sunday I made XXXX debit transaction. I was off my balance by - {$1.00} cents.

The promotional code that I used for the {$250.00} checking bonus was n't expired until XXXX XXXX which was after when my account was established. This code was confirmed originally by the phone agent, and the bank should have kept the recording of this phone call as proof of my claim. Moreover, I also have email proof of this promotion sent by the bank so there is no denying from the bank for refusing to honor it. The worst thing was with their customer service which seemed to have mostly been trained to tell all customers that the promotion was not from the bank at all, and the bank website has been hacked or at least the promotion page was hacked to send out this bonus. I have NEVER heard such a ridiculous response from any other financial institutions before, and it is seriously shocking to learn that a good sized bank like BMO Harris could NOT honor its bonus for whatever reason.  The second issue is with the XXXX monthly fees charged. I have to say that their banking system is the worst I have ever dealt with, even credit unions are having better systems to make the process easy to use and streamlined for their customers. When I created my online banking account I expect everything to be automated and did NOT have to call customer service to get it to work. This has been my experience with any other financial institutions that I 've dealt with, however BMO Harris system is different and does n't work without manual intervention. The request for refunds is for the amount of time and trouble it caused me to set it up successfully. If I received the initial temporary password that your website was supposedly to send out, I would have completed the enrollment process in no time and transferred in enough funds to waive the monthly fees.  So to summarize, I 'd appreciate CFPB to work on my behalf with the bank in order for them to honor my bonus, and refund the fees charged inappropriately. Thank you very much. ",dai77@purdue.edu,0

The car was finally perfect and I got to enjoy it for 8 months before a bad driver smashed it up. I was very stressed and sad for 2 months. I finally got some money for my  inconvenience '' from the other insurance company, which made me happy. I deposited this into my Chase account. After paying my medical bills, I was going to get to keep the rest of the money. I thought I would now be able to put the memories of my bad car accident behind me and move on. But, Chase Bank is preventing me from doing just that. Chase Bank is now causing me and my family a lot of stress all over again. I talked to another banker where I opened my new account and asked them how this could happen. They said usually there are XXXX reasons a bank will close someone 's account. Fraud or not getting along with the customer. I certainly have n't committed any fraud and I have never set foot into Chase Bank except for the day XXXX opened my account several months ago and again several weeks ago to inquire about my account getting closed. So, I never interacted with anyone that could say they found me hard to get along with. Please check into this for me. Thank you for your help. ",wang1509@purdue.edu,1

6925,"On XXXX XXXX 2016 XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX in XXXX XXXX provided a entry level basic paint service to a Visa card holder XXXX XXXX. The card holder paid for the services with his Visa card. In XXXX 2016 we received a letter from Wells Fargo Bank Merchant Services XXXX. XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX stating the card holder had put a dispute on charges claiming he is unhappy with the services and he had contacted XXXX and he was denied service or a refund. XXXX responded to the Merchant services that XXXX had no record of the card holder on anyone else on behalf of the card holder ever contacting our center to file any complaint or dispute on any services we have provided. XXXX provided copies of the Repair Order Contract, Final Invoice, Completion Certificate and Guaranty of Payment all signed by the customer to the merchant services. After review charge back was returned to XXXX. In XXXX 2016 we received another letter from Wells Fargo Merchant Services stating the card holder insisting he he is not satisfied with the service and claiming he has contacted XXXX and he was denied service or refund without any specifics. Once again XXXX responded with another letter to Merchant Services that neither XXXX repair center nor the XXXX toll free Customer Service has any record of the alleged customer ever contacting us to report any claim or dispute of any kind. We requested the XXXX XXXX to have the card holder contact us for followup. We have tried to contact the card holder via the contact information he had provided on his invoice in XXXX and have left voice mail with no reply. Wells Fargo Merchant Service returned the charge back to the card holder favoring card holder 's claim of contacting XXXX and refusal of XXXX to provid service or refund. We have requested Wells Fargo to provide us with any specifics, information dates time etc and they have not been able to. Rules and regulations in Charge Back Management Guideline for Visa Merchant Section XXXX : XXXX XXXX, states :  The cardholder claims that the terms of the sale were misrepresented by the merchant for this reason, the cardholder must have made a valid attempt to resolve the dispute or return the merchandise.Based on information provided and the card holder 's attempts to avoid having contact with XXXX, and XXXX 's inability to reach the cardholder via contact information he had provided thus preventing XXXX to have any opportunity to examine and substantiate any claim, we believe this is a classic case of what is referred to as Friendly Fraud. Fraud is one of the most common methods cardholders use to file a chargeback. Chargeback fraud occurs when a customer files a chargeback on a legitimate transaction instead of following the merchant 's procedures for requesting a refund. Well-intentioned customers may accidentally commit chargeback fraud because they are ignorant of the differences between a traditional refund and a bank-issued refund. They do n't know what chargeback fraud is and incorrectly assume a chargeback is simply an easier way to get their money back.Other consumers are aware of the loopholes in the chargeback process and knowingly abuse this consumer protection mechanism. For example, a customer will authorize a credit card transaction and later file a fraudulent chargeback once the item has been received. In this case, chargeback fraud is committed in the hopes of getting something for free. We believe the Wells Fargo Bank Merchant Services is in direct violation of Visa Chargeback Management Guide Section XXXX : Chargeback Reason Codes XXXX Merchant Services has failed to investigate the dispute to verify if the card holder 's claims of contacting XXXX and XXXX refusal is true. As a result XXXX has been defrauded. Please investigate and advise. Thank you XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXXXXXXXXXX ",ddye@purdue.edu,1

7007,"In XXXX 2016, I opened a Citigold checking account. I signed up for it because of an advertised promotion that promised XXXX miles would be credited to my AAdvantage account that was linked with my Citi AAdvantage credit card. The requirements of the bonus were : use the bill pay feature in two different months and spend {$1000.00} on the account 's debit card within three months of account opening. I read the terms of this promotion very carefully when signing up for the Citigold checking account, and there was no language indicating any reason that I would not have been eligible for this promotion.   After I completed these requirements and waited until the next billing period on my AAdvantage card, I was concerned that I did not receive the miles yet. I asked Citi customer support when I could expect to receive the reward from the promotion. I received a response that contained this [ excerpt ] :  Within 60 days after account opening you completed 1 qualifying bill payment to the new checking account during a calendar month and during the following calendar month.The bonus ThankYou points will be credited within 90 days from the end of the statement period in which you complete all offer requirements. For your records, the promotion code is XXXX. '' However, I knew this was a different promotion and I was confused by their response, so I wrote back to ask about the AAdvantage miles promotion. The response from Citi was the following [ excerpt ] :  I apologize that you were given misinformation in the previous message. You enrolled in the promotion XXXX for XXXX XXXX miles. However, you were not targeted for this promotion. Please note, enrollment does not guarantee qualification. While Citi does offer XXXX miles promotions at times, this offer is available only to targeted Citi card members who received the offer via a direct communication from Citi either by mail or email. Our records show you are not a targeted client. '' There was no language in the terms and conditions of the promotion stating this requirement about being  targeted '', and I would not have signed up for the account if I had any knowledge that I was ineligible for the promotion. From my research in the CFPB database of complaints, it seems that many other consumers signed up for Citigold accounts due to this advertisement of miles and were also bait-and-switched by Citi with a similar change of terms. Additionally, I am being charged {$30.00} in fees each month to keep the account open.   I have explained this to Citi and they have opened an investigation into the issue. I asked for clarification about what this means and when the issue could be resolved, but was not given any specifics -- only that investigations would be addressed in the order they are received, and that due to an  overwhelming amount of promotion inquires we are experiencing delayed response times ''. Interesting, I wonder why an overwhelming amount of promotion inquiries -- could it be because CitiBank is failing to honor their end of the promotional agreement?

I told him that I was making a deposit, and he directed me to the teller line. I approached the teller, a white male, and told him I needed to make a deposit of some cash and a check. He asked for my debit card, which I provided him. I then entered my security PIN on the WF Point of Sale terminal.   I opened a check ( {$220.00} ) that I had received from the United States Postal Service in front of him. He took the check, and I asked if I could receive a color copy. He said he could n't do a color copy, and instead asked if I wanted a B  W copy, to which I had declined.   He then proceeded to deposit the {$100.00} cash and asked if there was anything else I needed. I said no, and then the WF Point-of-Sale machine asked how I would like my receipt. I selected to have the receipt delivered electronically to my WF account inbox.   I had then remembered I needed to exchange some coins I brought from home. I mentioned this to him, and he seemed glad to help. He and I counted the coins together ( he used a plastic counting device ). The change amounted to a little more than {$10.00}, and he handed me a {$10.00} bill in addition to returning me some coins.   I thanked him, asking if there was anything else I needed to do.

The branch manager confirmed that there was no check that had been deposited in my account in the time period I gave her ( XXXX - XXXX XXXX ). She then asked me several times if I was sure I 'd gone to that exact WF, to which I replied in the affirmative.

I 'd requested to see the video tape to prove that I 'd been there, to which he refused, saying that I 'd need to file a Police Report to have access to the tape. I 'd asked him if there was any other way I could view the tape, to which he said, he 'd given me all my options, and hung up abruptly. ",chen1296@purdue.edu,1

7018,"In XXXX 2016 I opened a Citi ThankYou Premiere Credit Card. In XXXX 2016 I did research into other Citi products and account options and came across an online offer for XXXX ThankYou points for new customers that opened a Citi Gold Checking account. I decided that the bonus incentive was worth opening a new account and proceeded to do so using the online promotion code. I activated my account and received physical mail which I responded to to complete the new account process.   The requirements of receiving the new customer incentive offer was to use their eBill payment service for a period of 3 months after opening a new account - a requirement that I knew I could meet ( and did ).   A month after opening the checking account I called and spoke to a Citi Gold account representative to confirm that I was following all steps required to receive the promotion - I was assured I was doing everything as expected as per my promotion contract. I explicitly asked if after fulfilling my obligations that were part of the contract I would be eligible for the XXXX ThankYou points - his answer was  yes ''.   In XXXX ( 3 months after opening the account ) I called again to the Citi account reps. I went over the details of my promotion and the representative said that ALL THE REQUIREMENTS WERE MET and that the points should post to the account in 1-3 months.   In XXXX ( 5 months after opening the account ) I called to check the status of my promotional points. The representative that I spoke to was as confused as I was to why the points had not yet posted and opened a support ticket inquiry into the matter that would escalate the issue to their back offices. I waited a few days and then called back to find out the status of the inquiry. It was then that I was learned of their deceptive business practice.   The representative on the phone ( and later his supervisor when I asked to speak with her ) both told me that I was not part of their internal list of candidates for the promotion. Supposedly Citi mails/eMails out promotion codes only to certain prospective new customers and I was not on their internal list. This did not stop them from accepting my application with the referral code, taking my money, having their representatives confirm verbally my eligibility or charging me monthly account maintenance fees ( {$30.00} per month ) - all in an attempt to bait me into using their service with a non-existing reward at the end of the process.   I feel cheated by CitI Gold checking for taking my money in monthly fees ( {$30.00} per month ) only to deny me the sign up bonus that would have covered about a years worth of monthly fees. If I was not on their secret list of qualified customers, this should have been communicated MONTHS before wasting both time and money in a non-existing promotion. Why was I not confirmed or denied as soon as I signed up for a new account? Why were the representatives that I spoke to multiple times not made aware that I was not on their list for the documented bonus? Why should I have the responsibility of fulfilling the obligations of the promotion ( which I did withing the expected 3 month period ) and Citi not have the responsibility of rewarding that good behavior? Why should I comply with the terms on the contract only to have the same contract broken by Citi because I was later found not to be on their secret internal list of  qualified new customers ''?!   The only resolution I seek is for Citi to honor their promotional incentive and give me the XXXX ThankYou points as were promised.

I went back to a branch and was told that sometimes they assign online accounts to branches. I called the XXXX number again and they said there was nothing they could do. I go back to branch and escalate and they have someone from XXXX give me a call. They leave a name and number and no-one returns my call. Finally, I find someone and they say that it 's too old. I find a VP and he forwards it along and another person tells me that they ca n't find any promotion at that time. They ask for proof that there was a promotion ... how am I supposed to do that after all this time?   Now what is really infuriating ... I never got anyone to respond to this inquiry : overdraft fees that have been applied to my account since opening. I have been charged over {$2000.00} in overdraft fees.   I think what is most frustrating about the overdraft fees is that PNC has overdraft protection ( that I was never told about until my last conversation a month ago with a rep ). I have called dozens of times and made visits to try and understand the fees and how they relate to Bill Pay, CheckCard purchases, and of course the deposits I make to cover the transactions. While I do n't claim to be the best money manager, I have always moved money to PNC to cover such charges. Also, I 'm confused by the consistency of the messages I get ... in some cases I have the fees refunded, in other situations ( which are the same ) I do n't. I get the line from PNC reps that they can only offer a courtesy refund on charges once a year. But then as I go through my statements, some were refunded well within a year of each other.

I called in and the agent I spoke with could n't adequately explain the logic behind why I was charged. The way the information was listed on my account online suggested that I had enough funds in my account and that the overdraft fee is what overdrafted my account!

7027,"I currently have an open claim with Bank of America due to an incident of fraud on my checking account with them. I had noticed a charge in the nominal amount of {$77.00} from a company name I did not recognize. After querying the payment, I was informed that the same amount had been taken since XXXX/XXXX/XXXX. It was agreed that this was fraud and the money was refunded to the account on XXXX/XXXX/XXXX a day after the claim was initiated. On XXXX/XXXX/XXXX Bank of America decided that the charges did in fact stand and that we had made them so proceeded to take the entire sum of the charges totaling {$850.00} from my checking account. They did however credit XXXX amount of {$77.00} back to us on XXXX/XXXX/XXXX of those taken. This implies that XXXX is fraud but the other charges are not and presents yet another inconsistency in Bank of America 's claims procedure. Since then, the claim has become a full time job to fight. My wife and I have spent endless hours on the phone to the claims department, as well as having to go in branch. After demanding the paperwork and evidence Bank of America were basing their actions on, we received copies of agreements made with XXXX XXXX for items of furniture using our details. The details given were incredibly basic, with just my name, routing and account numbers being listed. Bank of America refuse to budge based on our routing number being present but these are readily available for hackers, fraudsters or mail thieves and as such, consumers rely on their banks to provide the safety they promise. However, Bank of America failed to provide this at even the most basic level in this instance. We were told by the claims department that the charges stood in part due to my signature being on the documents but it was not my signature. It was a printed version of my name, perhaps even done via an online form and nothing remotely close to my handwriting or signature. The agreements also did not contain my phone number or any other details customary to a finance application. There were so many red flags with this transaction that the principal ruling allowed for a refund of the money taken but the decision was bizarrely reversed by even more questionable evidence. So far, in addition to the aforementioned actions taken by Bank of America, there has been a consistent lack of adequate customer service and the claims department has been evasive at best. My wife has gone to the branch several times in the past week to demand help, usually to be told that nothing could be done and she should call the claims department. As both of us have spent countless hours doing just that, she has persisted in demanding help from the in branch staff. A cashier at the Bank of America in XXXX, off XXXX XXXX, told her that she could make an appointment for someone to call the claims department in branch and advocate for her. My wife was told that her  appointment '' would be the following Tuesday at XXXX and that she would have to bring all of the paperwork and documents we have.

7047,"I am filing a complaint against Citibank regarding my Savings XXXX account ( ending in XXXX ).  I check my online banking balances every day, and on XXXX XXXX, 2016 I noticed that the balance on my Citibank XXXX Plus account was {$490.00} which was {$4.00} short of the {$500.00} balance on my account the day before. I found this odd since according to Citibank online banking, there were no transactions posted or pending that took place to account for this {$4.00} difference. I sent a secure message to Citibank through online banking, and on XXXX XXXX, 2016 I received a reply back from a Citibank support representative  XXXX XXXX '' ( Reference : XXXX ) which said the following :  I would like to inform that Statement Savings Account ending in XXXX is enrolled in Basic Banking Account ( BBA ) package as standalone account which requires maintaining the average monthly balance of {$500.00} or more to avoid the monthly service fee of {$4.00}. The average monthly balance is calculated on balance of account and the monthly average is adding the daily balance of account for 30 days statement period and the total amount is divided by 30 ( days ) ; not ending balance on the account. Since you have n't maintained the monthly average balance of {$500.00} for the XXXX/XXXX/2016 to XXXX/XXXX/2016 statements cycle, your average balance was {$400.00}. so the service fee of {$4.00} was charged on the first business day of next statement cycle. '' I found this very surprising. For not even a second during the statement period of XXXX/XXXX/2016 to XXXX/XXXX/2016 was my balance in this account under {$500.00}. I had {$500.00} deposited and posted into my account on XXXX XXXX, 8 days before the start of the statement cycle. The only transactions during the statement cycle was a XXXX cent and XXXX cent deposit on the XXXX XXXX and later a XXXX cent withdrawal on XXXX XXXX. At no point during the statement cycle did the balance on my account dip below {$500.00} so I have no idea how Citibank calculated my average monthly balance to be  {$400.00}. '' I then called Citibank to clarify this matter on XXXX XXXX, and was connected to a Citibank supervisor  XXXX '' based in Texas. I spoke with her for almost an hour, and she was incredibly rude and unhelpful. When I complained to her about the irregularities in my account, she kept told me to refer to the terms and conditions. When I asked her to point out under where this {$4.00} charge would fall under in the Terms  Conditions for having an average monthly balance of over {$500.00} or how Citibank calculated my average monthly balance to be  {$400.00} '' she would leave me on hold for extended periods of time then tell me again to refer to the Terms  Conditions without explaining anything and eventually she hung up on my call.  I believe Citibank may be committing widespread financial fraud by fraudulently charging fees on their consumers. They are incorrectly charging monthly fees in violation of their own terms of service, and then hiding this fee by not even showing it as a transaction in their online banking website and simply taking the money out of the account. I doubt I am the only person affected by this, and Citibank may be systematically defrauding millions of Americans like me which is why I 'm imploring the CFPB to thoroughly investigate this matter. I am more than happy to provide account statements or any other documentation necessary. ",cfeurtad@purdue.edu,0

However, had the payments posted in a different order, the lesser amount first, we would have only been charged XXXX over draft fee. PNC did refund XXXX of the fees because we are not in the habit of over drafting. The thing is, since I have no visibility into the auto-payment posting times, I ca n't be sure that PNC is not maximizing the fees charged to me by posting the smaller of the auto-debits first.

7076,"My complaint against bank of America is twofold : 1 ) for a period of eleven days they improperly froze my accounts without notice and 2 ) when I withdrew most of my money from those accounts, they retaliated by changing the terms of my checking account without my knowledge or consent to make me incur in maintenance fees.   On XXXX XXXX I noticed that a payment to my student loan creditor had not been authorized. Upon inquiring with the loan creditor, they informed me that the reason my payment was not authorized was that my checking account ( from which the funds were to be debited ) was frozen. I immediately contacted Bank of America ( hereafter referred to as BOA ), which has been my primary banking institution since 2006. A representative confirmed that my account had indeed been frozen since XXXX XXXX. When I asked for an explanation, the representative only said they needed to confirm some information about my account. When I asked what information, they said they needed to confirm specifically my nationality and my citizenship status. I told him that neither my nationality nor my citizenship status had changed since I opened this account ( XXXX ), and that all my contact information was up to date. He insisted that he needed to know my citizenship status, to which I again responded that it had not changed since I opened the account. I questioned the legality of his line of questioning, and he mumbled something about President Obama 's anti money-laundering legislation. I asked specifically which provisions of said legislation he was alluding to, and he had no answer for me. He proceeded to unfreeze my account, but was unable to give me a reason as to why it was frozen in the first place.   In the months preceding this incident, I do remember receiving an email from Bank of America asking me to update my contact information. I obliged immediately. Since my information was up to date on XXXX XXXX, was no legitimate reason for them to have frozen my account.   As a result of this freeze, I incurred in fees from various creditors due to automated payments that were declined.   In the days following this incident, I contacted the XXXX in XXXX, NC to demand an explanation from BOA. A representative from BOA named XXXX XXXX contacted me on the phone on XXXX XXXX. She and I spoke on two occasions. In these conversations, she repeated that  federal law '' required that they confirm my citizenship status and nationality, but she was unable to cite or even name the alleged federal laws. I asked her if BOA had made any attempt to notify me either before or during the freeze, and she said that, to her knowledge, no attempt was made to contact me via phone, mail or email.   After this conversation, I moved most of my money to another baking institution. BOA retaliated by imposing punitive maintenance fee because my accounts have a  low balance ''. I contacted customer service via chat on XXXX XXXX to have these fees reversed, and a representative named XXXX told me that while she would reverse the fees this month, my account required a minimum daily balance of {$1500.00} so as to not incur in maintenance fees. I was shocked to hear this because when I opened this account in 2006, my agreement said that my checking account had minimum balance and no monthly maintenance fees, ad perpetuum. I have never changed my account type, nor have I ever agreed to these new terms. When I inquired when these terms were communicated to me, the representative said they were mailed to my home, but could not give me specific a date that my account was converted to a product now known as  Core Checking ''.

XXXX AAdvantage miles '' and a representative later told me I was eligible, completed the terms, and would be receiving the miles.   To elaborate, I waited until XXXX XXXX, 2 weeks after the latest date I was supposed to receive the miles, to send a secure message about the issue. At which point an investigation was opened and I was promised a response within 3-5 business days. I contacted Citi through their online chat after 5 days had passed without a response and a second request was placed, this time I was promised a response within 2 business days. After another 5 business days with no response, I contacted Citi over chat again and was this time basically told that I 'd hear back from the investigation when I hear back from the investigation. When I expressed my dissatisfaction I was given a phone number and told it was for the promotional department. The next day I called that number only to discover that it was Citi 's normal customer service number. After going through the prompts I was able to talk to a general customer service representative about the issue and was told she would personally contact the person assigned to my investigation and call me the next day. She did in fact call me the next day, making it the first time Citi ever followed through on their word, and that is when I found out the investigation team in the promotional department denied my claim while citing that I was never targeted for the promotion. After pushing even further, I was told I was indeed not eligible and there was no evidence of misinformation so I will never be seeing the miles. I completely disagree on all accounts and feel that Citi is simply trying to avoid honoring their side of the agreed upon terms.   So, in short, Citi baited me into signing up for a CitiGold account with a promotion and then made up an excuse to deny me the bonus I earned through the promotion. After some research it is clear that Citi has a history of doing this very thing to their customers and it should not be tolerated. ",gonza186@purdue.edu,0

7195,"I have been a member of Pentagon Federal Credit Union ( PENFED ) since 1999. During my tenure at the Penfed, I have often been offered many products and services ( i.e. Credit Cards ) ; but, each time I have applied I have been denied. As time went on, I began to notice a pattern and came to suspect blatant discrimination and began to challenge their quick denials. Four times I was turned down for a mere personal loan of XXXX before finally being approved after having to provide a number of documents, complain to the board, and speaking to high level managers. The loan was PAID IN FULL on time and early. Yet, when I asked for an additional loan, I was promptly denied. Yet, I began noticing how they would cater to the Latinos and Hispanics who were n't even born in this country, yet were able to get loans and anything else. Recently, I have also been noticing that PenFed is now starting to advertise : 'Great Rates for Everyone '. Yet, if this be true, then why do I continue to be denied products and services? Most recently, I was denied a car loan having been told : 'You have never had a loan like this before. ' What? Presumably, they were referring to an installment loan whereby, I had one from PenFed and a Student Loan. Prior to this, I was denied the {$500.00} Credit Protection on my Checking Account and then scolded when my account was depleted. If that were n't enough at one point, they serendipitously removed funds from my Savings into the Checking account in an futile attempt to bring the account current. I needed to stop a payment on a check whereby I was charged a fee. Unbeknownst to me, this fee could have been avoided if I had initiated the stop payment online. I was n't made aware of this until I called and was attempting to stop payment on another check. Much to my chagrin, I was not at all pleased. Truth is, I have been extremely unhappy and frustrated with PenFed for quite awhile because it is my firm belief and despite their denials, that I have been discriminated against and continues to this day. In terms of the car loan, I was expecting to take advantage of the low rates offered by Credit Unjons. Yet, as previously mentioned, I was denied. I did receive a car loan for the XXXX I had requested from PenFed ; but, at a much higher interest rate than is necessary. I also recently received a new XXXX Card. Hence, why am I not able to take advantage of all the products and services that as a member of this Credit Union offers? At this time, I am looking to refinance my vehicle ; but, extremely apprehensive about even applying due solely in part to the continued maltreatment. It is extremely frustrating to be a member of a Credit Union only to seek products and services outside of the CU in order to prove my credit worthiness before you will even consider taking a chance on me. That in itself is blatant discrimination because I have been told in the past that it is best that I find another creditor to take a chance before we do. Also, it is annoying to constantly hear how conservative they are. This fact is abundantly clear. It should be known that I initially took my concerns to NCUA whereby I have been referred to this agency for further assistance. ",asapra@purdue.edu,0

Even though I have been assured by Citi that I met all requirements to receive my bonus, the bank is now refusing to honor their end of the agreement. The CitiGold checking account has cost me { {$60.00} } in fees so far and does not deliver its promised benefits.   Citi must give bonus AAdvantage miles immediately and refund the {$60.00} fee that they have charged so far and or additional steps will be taken to collect my promised bonus and refund the charged fee.

7278,"I am the XXXX for my XXXX year old Mother. In XXXX of 2015 I was XXXX and unable to take care of our finances. My sister-in-law took advantage of the situation and stole my checkbook and credit cards as well as my Mothers. She went so far as to divert my telephone calls to her cell phone and took all the mail from our mailboxes. XX/XX/2015 I was able to have my phone fixed and began to receive calls from a branch of BB  T in XXXX, SC and we discovered that she had stolen both of our identities and accessed our bank accounts and credit cards. I had never had an overdraft nor had my mother and that is when we discovered the extent of what had taken place. Credit cards were charged to the max and forged checks were paid off of my account as well as my Mothers. BB  T did not close my Mothers account at that time. Only when my sister, who is a banker in Texas, talked with BB  T did the account get closed. The bank did refund a portion of the fraudulent transactions that were committed by XXXX 's but not all. My sister-in-law was even allowed to make a draw off of my home equity line of credit by telephone that the bank refused to refund to me, leaving me with an additional {$9000.00} debt I am now forced to repay. When my sister in Texas came home for XXXX in XXXX 2015 she went to the bank to ask about the forged checks. The bank refused to honor the forgeries because it was past a 60 day window. My sister contends that when I first reported the identity theft it was the bank 's responsibility to close the accounts and to advise us to go thru our bank statements to look for forged checks. The forged checks on my Mothers account was in excess of {$27000.00}.  I did press charges against my sister-in-law and provided copies of police reports to BB  T. I feel like not only did my sister-in-law take advantage of me but the bank did as well. They were not helpful at all and it appeared to me that they just wanted me to go away. I have since closed my checking account with BB  T and my Mother has also closed her accounts as well. I still have the home equity line of credit loan with BB  T but as soon as I can pay it off in full I will never do business with them again. They are in no ways  consumer '' friendly.

In XXXX/XXXX/2016, I submitted an application for a Citigold bank account using promo code XXXX which I had received from Citibank. The promotion was set to end on XXXX/XXXX/2016. Not knowing if I was indeed targeted for this promotion, I was not sure if my application might be approved. Hence I had confirmed via chat with a Citi Bank representative named XXXX on XXXX/XXXX/2016 that the application will be processed, and that I qualified for the bonus offer of XXXX XXXX points upon meeting the promotion requirements : Within 60 days, complete a purchase of { {$1000.00} } or more with your Citigold Debit card and perform XXXX or more bill payments for XXXX consecutive calendar months. This information should be discoverable as all conversations are recorded by Citibank. After I met the promotion requirements, I contacted via phone Citibank to confirm this and to inquire when to expect the points to be posted. During this conversation, a service request was logged by customer services to open an investigation ( reference number XXXX ). On XXXX/XXXX/2016, I received a formal letter from XXXX XXXX, Director, client research, informing me that there was no AAdvantage miles promotion offered in conjunction with the opening of my account. See attached letter from Citibank. This letter contradicts all discussions I had with Citi at the time I opened the account and at activation. I would not have opened the bank account with Citibank if it was for this promotion. I anticipated to use the points to plan for a vacation. I am requesting Citi to honor the set promotion. If I was indeed not targetted for the promotion, Citi should have rejected my application for opening the new account using the promo code. And not do it when I have opened the account, met all the necessary requirements and when it comes time to pay out the bonus.

First, there were XXXX different fraudulent withdrawals from my account, XXXX from an ATM, and XXXX money orders taken out at XXXX. Only XXXX authorization call/text was purportedly made.

I had submitted my personal information to the banker together with the forms required to open the account. The forms that I submitted include Account Enrollment Form, BB  T signature card form, Overdraft Decision Form. The account enrollment form was signed and given to the banker by me when she came to the university to open the account. However, the BB  T signature card form and overdraft decision form was mailed to me by the banker and I filled it, signed and sent it back by US mail around XXXX XXXX 2015. While opening the account, the banker did not provide me with any other details regarding my account. However, around XXXX XXXX 2015, there was some fraudulent activity that occur ed in my account which I came to know through overdraft notices received in the mail. I immediately notified the bank about this and they closed my account around XXXX XXXX 2015. I filed disputes with the bank regarding the fraudulent activity in my account. I filed complaints with the XXXX police department and USPS mail theft division. I submitted all these reports to BB  T to aid them in the dispute investigation process. The outcomes of the dispute I had filed with the bank was not in my favor. They rejected my dispute claim saying that the account opening process was all done according to their procedures. I was not satisfied with the response given to me and I went personally to the bank to request all the forms that I had submitted to them during the account opening process. The banker gave me a copy of the BB  T signature card form and to my shock, I noticed that the form I had submitted to the bank was different from the one they had in their system. The bank claims that my account was opened on XXXX XXXX, 2015 and they gave me a copy of the BB  T signature card form with my signature and date as XXXX XXXX, 2015. However, I did not sign and mail these forms to the bank till XXXX XXXX 2015. I came to know that the actual form I sent to the bank was not in their system and they had a different form in their system with a different date.

However, this week I received a call from another banker saying that they can not give me the forms and asked me to contact their legal department to obtain them. The banker told me that she does not have access to the forms. I questioned this statement, asking how another banker whom I was talking to last week was able to put in a request to obtain the forms and now she is telling me that they do not have access to it. This banker does not have a answer to my questions. I was persistent to obtain a copy of the forms for my record and this banker refused to even talk to me. She kept saying she has nothing to talk to us and we have to leave the place. My questions to her were : 1. Why does the branch not have a copy of the forms I submitted to them to open the account? They should have a file for me in the branch and that file should contain the forms.If so, why are they not willing to give it to me? When they can give me a copy of one of the forms, why not the rest?  2.

I have not benefited in any way from the deposit of a bad check that I had no way of knowing would be returned. I took responsibility and paid it in full so the bank has not suffered any losses as a result of what happened. I on the other hand have been unable to open an account at any bank and have  fraud '' associated with my name which is unacceptable.  The response to my first complaint mentioned nothing about the reason they reported to XXXX or XXXX. In fact the letter I received says they  investigated '' my complaint and found that my checking and savings account were closed due to me depositing a check that was returned. It says my account was closed for non-sufficient funds  activity '' or unsatisfactory handling and then goes on to say that the report they filed with XXXX and ews was accurate and will not remove it. It makes no mention of any  suspected fraud '' or any  attempted transacting '' with another account. It does not explain in way why I was reported for those reasons. To be reported for non-sufficient funds is VERY different from being reported for  fraud ''. The implications are extremely serious.  I would like for them to explain to me what I did that could be construed as fraudulent and also prove to me that I intended to commit fraud.

After I met all the terms and conditions to obtain the benefits of this offer, the incentive was not credited properly to my account. Thus, I made the first inquiry regarding this promotion in XXXX XXXX ( see Attachment 2 ), and the customer representative indeed confirmed that I met the requirements for the promotion and suggested me to wait longer since the incentive should be credited no later than the end of XXXX XXXX. However, Citibank never issued the credit and subsequently claimed that I did not qualify for this promotion which should be targeted to customers who received the promotion communication, even though I do receive the communication and can provide a photocopy of the printout as a proof of eligibility ( see Attachment 1 ).   I must reaffirm that the Citigold checking account offer was addressed to me and I have met all the terms and conditions to obtain the benefits of this offer. I should qualify for this promotion based on the following two reasons : First, I do receive a promotion communication regarding the new Citigold account offer and keep a physical printout of the offer disclosures ( see Attachment 1 ), which serves as a proof of eligibility. Second, I used the promotional code in the communication to apply for my Citigold checking account. My account was approved and the Citigold new account service team never informed me that I was not eligible for the promotion throughout the account reviewing/opening process.

Furthermore, the customer representative has confirmed that I met the requirements for the promotion when I made the first inquiry regarding this promotion in XXXX ( see Attachment 2 ).   Citibank should not take advantage of this misleading marketing advertisement to lure customers to open new accounts. Please keep in mind that there is also a relatively high monthly service fee associated with the Citigold account and it would take several months for new account holders to meet all the terms and conditions to obtain the promotional offer.

7575,"I 've just learned that when a person uses Capital One online Billpay they are at risk of having their money stolen by Capital One. Here 's how : When you approve an online bill payment the amount is debited from your account the moment you click  send ''. Then a check is sent to the payee. However, if 90 days pass and that check has not been cashed or deposited Capital One never returns the money to the customer / PAYER 's account and never notifies the customer. They just keep the amount of the transaction. Forever.   I 've just had this confirmed by a manager at Capital One. When I pressed him on Capital One therefore basically getting to keep my money he said  no its in limbo '' but that is not true. The amount still remains on Capital One 's books as an asset because the money has never been transfered to another financial institution as would happen when the check was deposited or cashed and the cashing or depositing institution requests the funds from Capital One. Not only is this practice fraudulent but when questioned on it Capital One counted on my ignorance of how banking works to lie to me about how they benefit from the policy.   In addition, while Capital One will never return your undistributed funds, the PAYEE only has 90 days to cash or deposit the check. You would think that after that same 90 days the funds would go back to the Customer / PAYER, but this is not the case.   Therefore, in essence, every time you send out a check with Capital One 's online billpay, an invisible 90 day timer starts, and when it 's up the PAYEE ca n't collect, the PAYER is never notified, and Capital One gets to keep the customer 's funds.   I have been informed by Capital One 's representatives that if you call and ask them to give the money back, they will, after charging you a fee. But If the PAYEE never informs you that they either did n't receive or deposit/cash the check Capital One never informs you, so you do n't even know to call and ask for your money back. Then they get to keep it. I 'm sure the combination of this policy, the lack of any notification from Capital One, and how they benefit is just a coincidence.   The basic form of this situation is : 1. I ask Capital One to perform a financial transaction for me ( Bill Pay ) 2. Capital one debits the amount of the transaction from my account.  3. The financial transaction does not complete within 90 days ( The Payee never receives or claims the funds ) 4. Capital one never notifies the customer that the transaction did not complete and never returns the funds.   How can this policy and order of events, confirmed by Capital One, be described as anything other than fraud? ",zhu316@purdue.edu,1

The representative she spoke with was helpful ; however, no mention of any fees that were to be charged for this service was ever made. In addition, while most consumers only request a few pages, resulting in {$20.00} - {$30.00}, or perhaps even a {$100.00} in charges, this request resulted in over XXXX pages being printed out, going back at least a year!  The total charges for this were as follows : Joint checking account : {$850.00} Joint savings account : {$520.00} Joint savings account : {$130.00} Daughter 's checking account : {$580.00} Total : {$2000.00} That is a TOTAL of over {$2000.00} for simple copying, printing, and shipping, with NONE of these charges ever being explained to my wife! In fact, when I called to complain, the manager of the bank refused to even consider refunding even part of these fees because they were  in the depositors ' agreement '' - a document that I last looked at sometime early this year!   This amount, is not only excessive, and exorbitant, I consider it to be literally,  highway robbery '', where the consumer is not told what fees are actually going to be charged at the time!   When I called to complain about these insane charges against our accounts, I was pushed to a  manager '' who refused to even discuss the accounts in question, refused to offer any sort of recourse or recompense, and actually was somewhat rude towards me.   This manager stated that  it 's in the depositors ' agreement '' and acted as if we should have known that these amounts were going to be charged, even though not one depositor probably looks at these documents except when they are mailed out by the bank, and even then, more than likely, 95 % of depositors probably only give it a brief once over!   Additionally, she stated that USAA, and its representatives are under absolutely no obligation to disclose fees to consumers since they are  explained in the depositors ' agreement ''.   While this might be ok for fees of under {$200.00} or {$300.00}, anything above that amount, should automatically require disclosure to the consumer, especially if these fees are going to cause an account to go into a negative balance!   With regards to accounts being charged so much that they go negative : our daughter 's checking account, was charged so much in fees, that it actually did result in negative balance, which will probably result in additional fees, and none of this was explained to my wife!   While both my wife and I have access to that account, that account belongs to our daughter, who was not privy to the charges that were being levied against her account, and this in and of itself, constitutes an illegal account access by USAA to that account to charge fees that were not theirs to charge.   When the representative on the phone does not even discuss these charges and ensure that the customer making the request is aware of these charges, or the TOTAL amount of them, charging the consumer, who has been a member, for at least the last 15 years, and to drain their accounts of almost {$2100.00} is outright theft!   These charges are completely out of line with the high quality of service I expected from USAA, and the fact that the manager was rude, and refused to even discuss what she might be able to do with regards to these charges does not speak well for USAA.

This created a snowball effect and several items posted to my account along with the {$35.00} OD fee for each transaction. By the time the dust settled, Bank of America had charged me {$450.00} in OD fees. In tears I asked the manager if I could get some assistance with some of the fees as I have been a long time customer with an excellent track record and XXXX mortgages with BOA.

The representative placed me on hold and came back to the line stating that the OD fees were not a result of a bank error and that I made the mistakes so therfore the fees are valid and she would not be able to assist me.  # 2. I went back to the branch and spoke directly to the branch manager along with a personal banker and they said :  If thats what customer service stated then there is nothing they can do ''.  # 3. I went back to the branch for a THIRD time and advised that I unknowingly received my last unemployment check on XX/XX/XXXX and all of my automatic bill payments came in because I was expecting a deposit into my account on XXXX XXXX. This time I asked if they could temporarily place a hold or freeze on my account to prevent additional debits and {$35.00} OD fees from accumulating to the point where I will not be able to resolve with no income. ONCE AGAIN, I WAS TOLD THERE IS NOTHING THEY COULD DO FOR ME AND THEY WERE SORRY. The branch manager opened some kind of  case '' that would go to his regional manager as she had the authority to waive some or all of these fees that were greatly hurting me.  # 4.

I called Citi back and spoke to a manager that said that they would open another investigation and I would hear back by XXXX/XXXX/XXXX. It is past that point and I have not yet heard back.   I have called numerous times and got nothing but a run-around. They have not acknowledged that if I was not going to receive a bonus it should have been communicated to me during numerous confirmations about the offer. It has been weeks of dealing with this and I am very disappointed that Citi would mislead and treat their customers in this manner. I have been a customer since XXXX and if this is not handled appropriately I will pursue it further with litigation and no longer do business with this company ever again.

7640,"I have an account with Ally Bank and over the past 6 months I have overdrafted my account between paychecks. The maximum amount that my account was overdrafted for was {$75.00}. On Wednesday, I deposited a check for the amount of {$4000.00} which now Ally bank is holding until XXXX XXXX for NSF reasons. When called multiple times, Ally Bank first informed me that they were required by law to hold the funds for 5 business days due to Regulation CC ( I looked up regulation CC and informed them that had no such requirement ; Regulation CC requires them to inform me if they place a hold, not place a hold itself ). Upon providing this information, the line went silent and the agent hung up on me. I called Ally bank back and was informed, that it does n't matter what I do. All checks will be held for up to 5 business days regardless of the amount. I find it grossly unfair that a bank can place a hold for an arbitrary amount due to repeated overdrafts ( I offered to have part of my check to be held that was a reasonable multiple of the overdrafted amount in the past ). Additionally, I find it fairly misleading that banking institutions are informing consumers that they are *required* to hold funds, while rather they are required to inform consumers to hold funds.

7657,I bank with PNC bank. I have a issue currently with a few transactions which caused my account to go negative and NSF charges that were imposed. What happened during this situation is as follows. I was out of town and knew there was going to be a charge go thru my account next week. I was aware of this so I was very cautious with my spending. To be extra cautious I made sure that when I made any type of charge to the account I checked the balance before hand to make sure the large charge did not come out before it should have so my account would not go negative. I have been told my the service reps at the bank that the processes were in real time so I took that to mean if there was a balance in the account that it would go in the order of the charge. THIS IS NOT WHAT HAPPENED. Although I checked before each and every charge the large charge I knew was coming ( although a week early as I was afraid of happening ) did end up going thru. Now the problem is all those charges that I double checked for a balance they did not process it the way they said it would. PNC processed the large charge first and then all the other small charges afterwards causing XXXX NSF charges. I called the bank and they once again told me that Everything processes in real time. I went back and forth with them and they ended up telling me the balance is just a tool. I was not satisfied with this and the case was elevated to a supervisor. I then received a phone call a few days later and the lady told me that things are not processed in real time. This is a stark contast to what I was told in person at the branch as swell as what the online CSR told me. She went on to tell me things are really processed when the receipts are sent to the bank for payments. Well this makes things impossible to try to fix if there was some type of error on the account. Anyway I feel like the bank was completely dishonest with me on how to try and protect myself against charges. If I would have know in the first place I would have just pulled out cash out of my account and paid with things that way so I did not have several hundred dollars in NSF charges. ,lo31@purdue.edu,1

So I applied and was hired.  They sent me by mail the first assignment and a check with the funds to do it. I had doubts about such an easy job, but I thought that if the check was valid it would be safe. So on XXXX/XXXX/16 I deposited a check for {$1800.00} into my bank account, and waited for the money to be available. After the bank showed the money in my account I asumed the check was clear, and it was safe to use the money for the job, so I withdrawaled it and used the money.  On XXXX/XXXX/16 I deposited a XXXX check from the same job, and when I did so the balance of my account was off.  After checking all the transactions from my account I noticed that on XXXX/XXXX/16 there was a transaction of return item for the {$1800.00}, the bank took back the money without any notice. I called them and found out that the check was n't valid. I asked them why did they acredited the money if it was n't valid and they said that they trusted me with handing them a valid check.  This is not a matter of trusting their clients, it is their job and responsability to clear the checks before putting the money into people 's accounts making them believe that their checks are valid, and they could use the money.  I withdrawaled {$1600.00} to do the assignment, because I believed that if the money was already in my account that meaned it was real and I had a job to perform as secret shopper.  Bank of America failed in doing their job, which is protecting their customer 's money, and now after they realized that the check that I deposited was n't valid they just removed the money from my account, and told me it is my responsability to verify the checks. I thought I did that by depositing the check and waiting for them to validate it.  Bank of America is helping the thieves steal their clients money, because they make their clients believed that they 've cleared the checks, when they have n't and the robbers must know this. I would n't have fallen in the scam if the bank had n't put the money in my account making me believe that it was all right to use it.  They never let me know that I had to wait for a period of time to use the money in my account, after I deposited a check and they complete the transaction by showing the money in my balance.  With this complaint I ask Bank of America to reinburse the amount of {$1800.00} to my account, as well as the return check fee.

7666,"Dear CPFB, At this point I feel as though I have no other choice than to involve a third party in order to get Citibank to cooperate with me and listen to my valid complaints. First and foremost, I have what was supposed to be a free checking account that I 've held for almost fifteen years without incident, but now almost never use. There appears to be many fees from Citibank attached to this so-called free checking account that I do not understand. Furthermore, when the account for some reason despite almost never being used became overdrawn, perhaps in part due to these mystery fees from Citibank, Citibank did NOT notify me. Instead, they allowed my overdraft account to become totally exhausted, in order to charge me additional interest and fees on the account, that much is clear, but rather than call me when this occurred, they sent me a letter which looked like an ordinary statement rather than call me. Citibank has claimed in said letter that they no longer have my contact information, even though none of it has changed in over ten years. This is either false on the part of Citibank, or it shows extreme incompetence in terms of their record keeping.   The most egregious part, is that even though I sent a certified letter to my branch begging them to please call me to answer my questions, they have ignored my request and instead reported my as DELINQUENT to the major credit bureaus. Without one phone call, and I have banked there for almost 15 years! I have very good credit, pay my bills on time, and have never been delinquent on a payment in my life, yet Citibank who I believe has a lot of explaining to do to ME in terms of this account has RUINED my hard earned credit.   This should not be allowed to happen. They should be investigated and they should provide me with the answers I am seeking.

The following is a part of the message I did receive :  I will be more than happy to assist you with the XXXX AA miles promotion for checking account ending in XXXX. Thank you for providing your AA account number. Our records show promotion code XXXX is applied to your checking account.

Within 60 days after account opening : complete Qualifying Debit Card Purchases of {$1000.00} using the Citibank Debit Card which must be posted to the new checking account. And 1 qualifying bill payment must be posted to the new checking account each month for XXXX consecutive calendar months.

On XXXX/XXXX/XXXX, I have confirmed with the bank that the requirements were met and this was their answer :  After reviewing your account, I see that you completed the requirements, and were met on the statement cycle that ended on XXXX/XXXX/XXXX, please allow up to 90 days for the bonus miles to be credited. '' After more than 90 days noticing that the bonus was not posted to my account I reached again to them and they told me :  After reviewing your account, I can confirm you completed the requirements, please note the bonus miles are processed by the end of the statement cycle of XX/XX/XXXX, please allow up to XXXX weeks for processing, if you have not received the bonus miles by XXXX XXXX you may reach out to us by phone or send another message and we will gladly open a case for further research.

Subsequently, I am submitting this formal complaint because I judge that Citibank has been very misleading to me in this transaction.

I was appalled, shocked and hurt. I have been banking with you guys for the last 6 years because you guys are the closest branch to where I live. I went to the bank later that day and was told they could do nothing for me and my money would be sent out in a check to my home, at this point I do n't know who to reach at this point and everyone has continuously transferred me to the account risk department to be told the same thing but no one as actually cared or concerned themselves to help me resolve an issue and at this point no one is giving me a chance and I 'm just being kicked out of BankOfAmerica and forced to open up an account with a new bank.

7691,"On XXXX XXXX, I closed my account because of some issues, and because I was in the process of withdrawing my authorization from some internet lenders, who I was told were void in my state. The XXXX dollars that were in the account were transferred to a new account, and the old account was closed. I alerted all of the other entities that I wanted to continue to have access to my account, the new account number. I did not include the lenders, because they are void, and because I was withdrawing their authorization. I did not give them permission to the new account. At that time, the gentleman, XXXX XXXX, who helped me close the account and transfer the small amount of money in it said that anything outstanding that had been authorized to debit from the account within 24 hours of closing would be taken out, but that after that, the account would be closed for good. No attempt by any entity to debit my account occurred during that timeframe, so I was under the impression that the account was completely closed. I was getting help crafting the authorization withdrawal from the internet lenders since last week. When I looked at my email today, I had an email from SunTrust saying that there was an error on the  closed '' account, and that I had an overdraft, and that I needed to take care of it as soon as possible. It went on to say that my balance on the  closed '' account was negative as of XXXX/XXXX/16, and that I had to bring it to a positive status within five business days.  I was shocked to see that the  closed '' account, was re-opened to pay the lenders I did not want to continue to do business with. I called the bank, and went in to speak with XXXX XXXX at XXXX today. I asked why there was an overdraft on a closed account. He said to me that I had given the lenders authorization, and that because of that Suntrust has the right to open up a closed account to allow what used to be a regular debit from that account, even a week after the account had been closed.  I was shocked an a appalled that my bank could re-open a closed account to cover an entity I was trying to cut ties with. Verbal authorizations do n't seem to work, so I am now doing written authorization withdrawals, because I can not trust my bank to actually close my account and leave it closed. Also because they re-opened a closed account, lenders will be able to debit again and again, putting my account further in the negative! I am disgusted and disappointed at Suntrust, that they can decide that if I gave authorization, they get to decide how and when I pay the lenders and not me. I closed my account as a first step in the process to disengage from the illegal lenders, and SunTrust is trying to profit. They are playing the role of the decider, instead of me, the consumer. I never thought that a closed account can be re-opened by the discretion of the bank, even though I never asked them to. I gave my new account information to the entities that I wanted to continue to do business with. I now  owe '' Suntrust for a service I never asked them for. I think they are doing this to padd their pockets. By re-opening the account, other lenders can and will try to debit, creating a bigger hole, and deficit that I have to make up and owe to the bank and the lender. Disgusting. ",jdenhar@purdue.edu,0
7692,"On XXXX XXXX, 2016, I applied on line for a 7 year IRA CD with Discover Bank. The rate was 2.23 percent ( 2.25 APY ). The CD would be funded by direct transfer from my XXXX brokerage account. I was told that I would receive the required forms to sign and return within XXXX to XXXX business days. As of XXXX XXXX, I still had not received the paperwork. I was out of town the following week, and received the paperwork Monday XXXX XXXX. That same day I returned the required paperwork via standard mail to Discover. The next couple of weeks I periodically called Discover to find out the status of the transfer of cash from XXXX. I received various answers from them, but was all but assured that the rate had not changed since the first of 2016 and most likely would not change before the XXXX was funded. I finally found a Discover agent on the phone who told me that the transfer had to be initiated by XXXX. The same day, I downloaded, signed and sent the transfer request directly to the XXXX Transfer of Assets ( TOA ) office. XXXX expeditiously sent the form to Discover. Discover claimed they received the form on XXXX XXXX. I received a letter from XXXX that the funds were transferred on XXXX XXXX.  From XXXX XXXX through XX/XX/XXXX, I checked my Discover account on line to see if the funds had been received. My account showed XXXX balance BUT still showed the interest rate of 2.23 percent ( XXXX APY ). On Monday, XXXX XXXX, I again called Discover Bank. I was told that the funds posted on XXXX XXXX ( Sunday ). On XXXX XXXX the funds still did not show up in my account, BUT the rate still showed XXXX percent ( XXXX APY ). On XXXX XXXX, I checked the account on line only to find out that the funds had posted, BUT the rate had now changed to XXXX percent ( XXXX APY ).  I immediately called Discover Bank and eventually talked to their supervisor, XXXX. She stated that the rates went down on XXXX XXXX and that to undo the 7 year IRA XXXX would cost me XXXX moths worth of interest. At first she told me that Discover had received the transfer on XXXX XXXX, BUT then back tracked and said the money was received on XXXX. At no time was I notified of the rate reduction prior to the funding of the account. Even on XX/XX/XXXX, when I checked the account on line, it still showed 2.23 percent. XXXX 's response was  you get the current rate when the account is funded '' The current rate shown on my account when it was funded was 2.23 percent. If I had known of the rate decrease, I could have stopped the funding and cancelled the transfer. After having the CD for one day, Discover now wants to charge me 2 years interest for undoing the transaction. They allow NO grace period to see if the agreed upon rate has changed and they do not inform you of any proposed change.  I would like to reiterate that 1. the entire transaction took from XXXX XXXX to XXXX XXXX to complete ; 2. there was no indication or notification that the rate would change substantially downward ( including the rate shown on my account through XXXX XXXX when accessing on line ) ; 3. once Discover received the transfer, there was no grace period to allow me to accept or reject the substantially lower rate ; and 4. even though Discover has held my funds for one day, they want two years of interest to undo the transaction.  As a side note, when I returned the required signature forms, I received a letter a week later stating that the forms were incomplete. I called up Discover and they said the forms were complete, that it was their mistake. I talked to Discover 's agent a few days later, wondering why the funds had not transferred. They said they would send me the appropriate forms. When I received those forms, they were forms for transferring funds from Discover, not to Discover.

7769,"I went to the XXXX XXXX Bank of America ( XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX CA XXXX ) to request a mortgage loan on XXXX/XXXX/2016. I spoke with their mortgage loan officer. I provided him with the required documentation and after he reviewed it and made calculations he provided me with a conditional approval letter. At that time, he stated that I could start looking for properties and could submit offers ; as I would be looked as a serious buyer with the letter he provided me with. Approximately a week later, I found a condo I liked, but it required a higher amount than what the conditional pre-approval letter stated. I visited him again to sign additional documentation and I inquired about the possibility of increasing my loan. He stated that I could increase my loan amount by {$10000.00}. A day or two later he contacted me and told me that I should stick with the parameters set during the time that he gave me the conditional approval letter. He wished me luck and said that once I found a property the loan was going to be processed quickly as everything was in line. I proceeded to look for a property that fit the parameters he had given me. On Saturday, XXXX/XXXX/2016, I had my agent submit an offer on an ideal property. After consideration from the seller, who received six offers, my offer was accepted. Approximately an hour before I received the news that my offer was accepted on XXXX/XXXX/2016, the loan officer called me to tell me that the loan amount he had originally pre-qualified me for was not applicable. After several frustrating calls, I decided to take time off from work and make an appointment to see him the next day, as I needed to make a deposit so that escrow could open on the house. During this meeting, the loan officer said that information had come in after reviewing my tax returns and it caused my monthly income to be lowered, thus putting me above the debt to income ratio. However, even with this information, he continued to provide me with false hope. He told me that he was going to do what ever he could to resolve this issue. He also suggested that if he could not fix the issue, I could provide an additional {$10000.00} to the {$40000.00} down-payment and it would lower my debt to income ration below the 43 % ratio. As a buyer, I told him that I could n't provide {$10000.00} out of thin air. I left his office and was to expect a call from him before noon. At XXXX I called him and he said that he got his superiors to look into my file. Once again, he provided me with false hope as he said that their decision to even look at my file was a good indicator of potentially approving my loan. He told me he would call me by XXXX with a final decision. During this time, I proceeded to ask my friends for a loan in case it was necessary. I managed to secure a {$10000.00} loan from one of my friends. When he called at XXXX he stated that it was impossible to approve the loan as is. I then told him that I could provide the additional {$10000.00} on top of the down-payment. At this time he said that that was not a possibility. I was baffled as he had just told me that earlier. He stated that I misunderstood and that in order to get the loan I needed, I would have to put down {$80000.00}. As a result, I lost the house I was so excited to purchase. Being a first time home buyer is an already difficult time, but Bank of America 's mortgage loan officer made this experience a complete nightmare. If he had been honest and realistic with his information, I would have never been put in such a predicament. I felt like a fool as I presented myself as a serious buyer to the seller being backed up by what I believed to be a reputable institution.

7782,"I am a joint owner on my college age son 's checking account. Back in XXXX his account had a fraudulent transaction charged to his debit card. We have spent the past 6 months battling with PNC Bank, regarding this obvious fraud.   The circumstances of the fraud are described as follows. My Ohio son was in Maryland for a fishing tournament and had an accident. A towing company towed his friend 's boat trailer to their lot and verbally agreed to tow the boat for {$220.00} and to store the boat and trailer for {$35.00} dollars a day until his friend 's dad could arrange for the transport of the boat and trailer back to XXXX. They said there would be an additional {$120.00} charge to help get the boat on a trailer once XXXX was arranged. My son at that time gave the owner his debit card number.   The boat was on the lot for 10 days. When the charge came through my son 's account, it was for {$1100.00}, considerably more than we expected. We tried to call the towing company several times to get a copy of the invoice to no avail. At that time, we felt there was nothing to do but to dispute the charges.   I figured that my son 's case would surely go in our favor since my son never signed any paperwork or gave the towing company his pin number. We were disappointed to find that the dispute was ruled against us. As such, I requested copies of what the towing company submitted because I was certain they did not have my son 's signature. Between the time we initially submitted the paperwork related to the dispute and the bank 's initial ruling, we were made aware that the towing company had sent an estimated bill to the boat owner that quoted a {$250.00} towing fee, a daily storage rate of {$35.00} per day and also randomly added a {$50.00}  administrative fee ''.   I compared the invoice that the boat owner forwarded to us and the invoice that PNC supplied us and was shocked to see that the XXXX invoices were the same, but that the daily rate had been whited out and changed from {$35.00} to {$70.00} per day. The date was also altered on the invoice. Armed with what I was convinced was proof that this towing company is owned by dishonest and fraudulent people, I appealed the initial ruling. I also noted that there was, as I suspected, no evidence of any signature at all from my son authorizing any charges at all.   Despite the fact that PNC had proof that the towing company had doctored their invoice we again lost the dispute.   I went to my branch to appeal my case to a live person. She could see the obvious fraud and called someone in their bank to appeal. After XXXX more follow up calls to her and no return call from her illusive bank contact, I again went to the branch and spoke to an assistant manager. She sent my info to their retail escalation manager. That person called my son and left a message. He returned her call 3 times getting her voicemail every time. We then got a letter from her stating that our matter was resolved. There was no detail as to how it was resolved. I again tried to call her to find out more information and guess what? I got her voicemail. I pressed XXXX to speak to another agent and she told me too much time had passed and they were n't going to do anything.   I have attached a lot of documentation regarding the matter. The most important of which is the XXXX copies of the EXACT invoice that obviously shows the fraud this vendor has committed.

After approximately a month, I contact Citi again to ask when the miles would post. They placed an inquiry request on my account to look into it, and I was then notified that my account was not targeted and I would not be receiving the promised miles. Because I confirmed multiple times, and have a transcript of the secure chat in which I was told I was eligible and did complete the requirements, I believe Citi should honor the promotion they promised.

I requested and completed paperwork for my checking, savings, and credit cards to be converted to Military accounts. This conversion would have given me specific benefits that save me a lot of money while over seas and banking. Over the many years that have past, I continued using my bank of America products, such as my debit card. As a loyal member, I never second guessed the bank. I simply did n't have the time to check on my statements and was preoccupied with other important issues, within the Military. Worrying about my bank statements was the last thing on my mind.

When I logged in to my bank of America accounts, I was stunned to learn that I did n't have access to more than several months of information. I began looking through the information I had available. I noticed there were so many fees. There were maintenance fees, International Transaction fees, ATM fees from over seas, overdraft protection fees, and it almost seemed as if there were fees for having too many fees. I called the bank and requested my account be closed, after 11 years of membership. I was told by the representative that my account had never been processed to reflect it was a Military account. This failure to complete that process, meant that I did n't receive the benefits of a Military account. The representative quickly reimbursed me for maintenance fees for this month only. I was informed that I should not have been subject to any fees, specifically maintenance fees of unknown amounts ( as the fee price has fluctuated over my tenure as a member ) and transaction fees, as well. Not to mention, she stated that ATM fees should have been waived too. She quickly transferred me to the Military Department. The new representative agreed that the Military accounts have specific benefits which civilian accounts do n't share. But, unlike the first representative he refused to tell me what those benefits might be. Instead, he asked me to wait a few days, while they reviewed the account to determine which benefits they will approve for me. I was appalled, as the benefits should be what they are, despite the current status of my account.

Second I entered the promotional code from the promotional flyer when applying for my Citigold checking account.

Citibank should not take advantage of this misleading marketing advertisement to lure customers to open new accounts.

This case had about {$700.00} ( XXXX checks ) deposited Sunday morning. Assuming they would at least be partially available Tuesday, I scheduled bill payments for Tuesday and Wednesday. I received an email Tuesday morning that multiple overdrafts occurred. Then I got an email that my deposit checks would be held for XXXX5 business days from this Tuesday. I called and they said in fact 5 business days from Tuesday, meaning that I made the deposit on XXXX and it would be available XXXX. The reasoning is  too many overdrafts ''.   My issue is that 1 ) I was as never notified that I 've had  too many overdrafts '' and fell into this category. It has never been this way. I have never had a bounced check. How many is  too many ''? Why 5 days instead of XXXX, in XXXX? Why 5 days from Tuesday, not the day the deposit as made? If the deposit availability was clearer, I would never have overdrafts but this cycle just continues.  2 ) the bank should notify me, at the latest, Monday, for a Sunday deposit if there will be a hold l, so that I can not schedule bill payments. This would prevent these overdrafts 3 ) the reason this check is on hold ( overdrafts ) is causing more overdrafts and thus continuing the cycle.  4 ) with this very long hold, there will likely be an overdraft every single day from now until the money is available. A {$25.00} fee each day for the next XXXX8 days, plus the returned payments from the loans/creditors. It will end up costing me more in fees than the original deposit and in the end I will again be negative and overdrafted from the fees, even after the deposits are made available.  All of this could have been prevented and been more fair if the bank had notified me that either my account was in this situation where desposits would be held or notified me in the first 24 hours of making the deposit that this would be the situation. Neither was done, and I assume it was in order to capitalize on the massive fees.  This entire practice is so very unfair. It is my money being held so long and at the bank 's discretion, which they deceptively practice. It continues the cycle of massive overdraft fees and making the bills I try to pay bounce.   This bank also practices processing all outgoing payments prior to all deposits for each day which maximizes their overdraft potential. This has left me with a positive balance for a day even though I ended up with overdraft fees. Again, very deceptive and maximizing these fees, in addition to putting me into an unnecessary category of  too many overdrafts ''. ",fu58@purdue.edu,0

However, the money did n't go into his account but went into different person 's ( C ) account because that person 's account was registered with that phone number.

They told me that they have to get a verbal authorization from the person who has the money ( C ) in order to take money and give it to me. However, they told me that they had to deny my case because they could not contact the person who has the money ( C ). They said they could only contact them via phone, but that phone number is now owned by my friend ( A ) so every time they called, my friend answered the phone. I asked BOA if they could send the person who has the money ( C ) an email or actual mail asking him/her to give the bank a call about the case, but the bank refused to do so. They said they can not do that. They said I have to take a legal action in order for them to release other information such as address or email address of the person who has the money ( C ). I complained about the fact that the money went into a different person 's account even though I entered the name of the person I intended to send money to ( A ) ; however, the bank said that they only use the phone number to match the account and the name is only for my reference. As of now, the bank is not cooperating to contact the person who has the money. There is no way for me to contact that person because I do n't know anything about the person besides the fact that his/her old phone number is registered with the account so my money went into his/hers.

By way of background, here is the problem : I am currently located in XXXX but receive physical checks from my freelancing work. These physical checks are delivered to my US address, XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX XXXX, California, XXXX because international mail is both expensive and inconsistent. While I previously had these checks sent to directly to my US bank account, my bank decided, for unknown reasons to close my bank account. As a result, I have been unable to cash about 6 months worth of checks and have been having significant financial troubles. While I could resolve this situation by traveling back to the US and opening up another bank account I am prohibited from doing so because of the associated cost. Despite having over one thousand dollars in soon-to-be stale checks in the US, I am unable to access any of the monies from those checks.   I am writing this complaint in hopes that Chase Bank will provide me with a detailed response on how I can get those checks cashed and gain access to the monies. Thus far I have tried : 1. ) Giving my mother, who is receiving the checks at my former US address, a Durable Power Of Attorney. The bank refused to honor this Power Of Attorney despite it being fully signed and executed. The bank states that I must have the Power Of Attorney notarized, however, XXXX is not a signatory to the XXXX and thus is not allowed to do international notarization. At the same time, the US Consulate provides notarization services but traveling to and from the US Consulate and paying the notarization fee is beyond my financial means.  2. ) Other means such as sending the checks to XXXX, signing the checks, then sending them back to the US and then having my mother deposit the now endorsed check. It works but because of the shipping times involved, some of the checks become stale dated and expired, thus limiting my ability to gain access to my funds.

On XXXX/XXXX/16 we received a phone call after XXXX from the XXXX XXXX Santander Branch in XXXX, PA saying that our account was overdrawn due to XXXX transactions, XXXX of which were dated XXXX/XXXX/16 and the XXXX others dated XXXX/XXXX/16. I went immediately the next day on XXXX/XXXX/16 in good faith to pay the {$67.00} that I owed them for the XXXX transactions by paypal and asked how these transactions could go through 2 days and 5 days after an account was closed with a {$0.00} and negative balance. I was told that if transactions are made before the account was closed within 24-48 hours the account will reopen and transactions will continue even with a negative balance. They could not provide any written policy when asked. I paid the {$67.00} for the XXXX charges and asked them to dispute the {$140.00} in overdraft charges. At the same time they had informed me that the savings account was n't properly closed because there was still {$0.00} left in the account so I am not even sure the Branch closed the account properly and just did a withdrawal versus closing. On XXXX/XXXX/16 I received a call from XXXX at the Santander Bank collections department trying to collect the {$140.00} and I told them the account was being disputed and she did n't even realize the account was closed making me more skeptical if the account was closed. She then forwarded me to XXXX at the customer service department. After explaining my situation he kept me on hold several times for 30 minutes saying they were speaking about it and said they could n't help me and I have to go back to the branch. I asked for the supervisors name and he said the calls are recorded if I was going to file a complaint. I asked him to forward me to his supervisor which he did.She then told me that the bank will allow transactions up to 30 days on closed accounts not the 24-48 hours the branch told me. When I asked if they had a written policy she admitted they did n't. At this point it seems like the bank is acting recklessly with no written policy on how to handle closed accounts and how long they accept charges. As recommended by customer service I contacted the XXXX XXXX branch in XXXX, PA on XXXX/XXXX/16 hoping to speak the branch manager. I spoke to XXXX who told me that the branch manager was n't available today or on Saturday and I could try back next week if I wanted to. She told me he told her to tell me to contact customer service. When I told them I spoke to customer service and they told me to contact the branch manager she told me that is what he told me and I can try back next week if I wanted to. At this point I told XXXX that no one can give me a straight answer and told her I was contacting the Consumer Finance Bureau she said go ahead and hung up. I called back trying to speak to XXXX who I spoke to on XXXX/XXXX/2016 at XXXX and was told she was with a customer and she never called me back. I feel that the bank is taking advantage of us and trying to corner us into paying the overdraft fees by sending me to branch to customer service and back and forth in a wild goose chase. I think the bank is acting recklessly and committing fraud by closing accounts and accepting debits on the accounts with {$0.00} or negative balances to collect overdraft fees and not notifying the account holder until a week later. I work for a bank and have spoken to a former Santander Branch Manager, a lender at the bank, a branch manager at my bank and they have all agreed that they are not right and not acting in good faith and should return our fees after I already paid the debited amounts in full.

8369,"Dear CFPB, I received a call from XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX ( originator ID : XXXX ) from my local US Bank branch, offering me a credit card I was eligible for, which I declined. He also mentioned that I currently had a {$500.00} overdraft protection account, and I could be eligible for a line of credit up to {$5000.00} at a lower interest rate. I told him I was interested and authorized him to proceed with a credit check to determine the amount and terms of my eligibility.  The very next contact I received was a VOICEMAIL from XXXX XXXX, telling me that I have been approved at {$5000.00}, that the account has been set up, that I 'd receive a credit card in the mail ( which is what I clearly did n't want in the first place ) that I could just not use, and that it was at a lower interest rate than my previous overdraft account. This turned out to be 13.5 %, though I was never told that until much later.  A few days later I received a letter from US Bank showing me my XXXX credit score for this loan at XXXX as of XXXX. I found this to be an error, as I keep very close track to my XXXX and XXXX credit scores, XXXX of which have been at XXXX for quite some time and have had absolutely no major changes that would result in a XXXX point swing over the course of 9 days. I logged onto XXXX on XXXX and found my credit score to in fact be XXXX.  Upon contacting the bank about this, XXXX XXXX did in fact verify that he saw my credit score as currently XXXX. I was told by the manager, XXXX XXXX XXXX, that they had it on file as of XXXX at XXXX and there was nothing we could do about it for another 6 months until the next review of my creditworthiness. I called US Bank 's credit services and worked my way XXXX levels up the customer support chain to speak to a very kind gentleman ( XXXX? ) who explained that there is literally not a mechanism in the US Bank system that lets them manually review/adjust someone 's credit score. I was n't asking for anything special, all I wanted was an account with an interest rate based on my credit score. Due to the lack of a mechanism to achieve this, what I had to settle for is to reapply now, get it approved at the correct rate ( which will result in a second inquiry to my credit ).  With that as the backdrop, I have XXXX primary issues that I 'm reporting to the XXXX : -First and foremost, these strike me as incredibly loose and dangerous lending practices, and I can not imagine US Bank would approve of or teach this process. The terms of the line of credit were NEVER discussed or agreed to by me prior to the account being set up, namely the interest rate and the score it was based upon, fees, terms, etc. If it had, I would have said I disagreed with the score at that time and we would n't be here now.  Additionally, as I 've reapplied, I found out that while 13.5 % was in fact lower than the interest rate overdraft protection account it was replacing, but it is also THE HIGHEST POSSIBLE INTEREST RATE YOU COULD HAVE ON THIS CREDIT LINE. This is an absolute slap in the face.  Furthermore, while reapplying for the line of credit, I was asked questions regarding military service and whether I was or related to a senior political figure, both of which are fluid topic. Point being I was not asked about this by the loan originator, and it somehow got processed anyway. I was also shown the terms of the line of credit, including fees, penalties, and a lot of other information any reasonable human being would expect to be reviewed prior to the account actually being set up. I was blown away at how thorough the websites process was, and how XXXX employees appear to be offering credit products in a manner that would be unscrupulous at best, and illegal at worst.  -My second complaint is the fact that US Bank and frankly any financial institution would not have a mechanism in place to manually override these types of issue ",zhu316@purdue.edu,0

8383,"My wife, XXXX, and I applied to Bank of America for a Home Equity Loan ( HEL ). The BOA person we communicated with was : XXXX.   While we greatly need this loan, we are very concerned about our privacy, so on XXXX XXXX, 2016, we emailed XXXX XXXX :  Hello.  We received your list of documents you require for BOA to process our home equity loan request. Thank you very much. We do understand your need for these documents. These requested documents contain a lot of very personal and private information. Bank of America is a huge global company. We now live in a very dangerous world, so of course, we are very concerned about how BOA will use our personal and private info. We have found that in the past, when dealing with financial companies, whether to open up an account or seek a loan, they apparently sell and distribute your personal and private information to just about anyone and everyone willing to pay for it. We know this for a fact because since contacting financial companies about getting a loan ( eg : reverse mortgage ), for example, the amount of email scam spams I get at this email address has increased by a factor of about 5 - mostly scams related to XXXX, get-rich-quick, work-at-home, and payday loan schemes. Because people need loans, does not give crooked financial companies the right to victimize them.   Consequently, we want a clear WRITTEN confidentiality promise from Bank of America that it will : ( 1 ) Never sell any of our personal or private info to anyone, and ( 2 ) Never provide, distribute or report any of our personal or private info to anyone who is not both a responsible BOA employee and one who has a fully justifiable and legitimate need to know our info for the sole purpose of processing our loan application.  Please respond by email. We await your email response. '' We never got an email response to this email. A few days later, both my wife and I got letters dated XXXX XXXX from BOA disapproving of our HEL application. We believe that BOA retaliated against us because we have the nerve to try to protect our personal and private data from BOA 's greedy exploitations of our data for profit. Likely, a common practice with financial companies.   OTHER ISSUE # 1 : One of the reasons BOA gave for refusing us was,  Too Many Inquiries Last 12 Months. '' CFPB must stop this abusive practice because it is illegitimate to punish people trying to comparison shop for the best financial product for them, forcing poor people into rip-off deals with financial companies. It is Restraint of Trade. For example, what if you went to XXXX stores to look for a hat, and found it in the XXXX store, and was told that because you inquired in XXXX other stores, he/she ca n't sell you the hat or must sell it to you at a higher price because your other visits lowered your credit score?   OTHER ISSUE # 2 : The CFPB must put Credit Scores ( CS ) out of business! Your CS goes down for many reasons, many of them erroneous and false reasons. Americans are now enslaved by the CS. Poor people typically have low CS, which accelerates them into greater poverty and bars any possible recovery. CS is one of the main reasons for the transfer of wealth to the rich at the expense of the middle class and poor. CS is a criminal tool for thieves. ",quinn35@purdue.edu,0

After speaking in circles with the representative for over 30 minutes trying to find out why late fees had been assessed and being repeatedly told that I was only making  partial payments '' of {$97.00} and no explanation as to when or how {$97.00} became a partial payment, I requested to speak with a manager. The manager came on the phone and stated that while the late fee from XX/XX/XXXX had been waived, it was only waived from the total amount due and not what was due for the month. Therefore, I owed {$97.00} plus {$25.00} for the late fee in XX/XX/XXXX and only paid {$97.00}. So in XX/XX/XXXX, I was assessed an additional late fee and again, I only sent {$97.00} so now I owed over {$170.00}. I asked if it made any sense to him that a waived late fee still needed to be paid and that this same  ghost '' late fee would then continue to incur XXXX more late fees. I was told that I had to pay what they showed as being due or I would continue to incur late fees. How can a bank waive a fee and then continue to say it is due and on top of that, charge you late fees for not paying the waived fee? This policy was set up for no other reason than to enable the bank to be able to continuously still its hands into your pockets for literally, no reason. ",bbrumfi@purdue.edu,0

On XXXX/XXXX/2016 the charge of {$370.00} was then debited from my account. When I called in the the customer service team, I was told by the XXXX rep that the charge was only pending, and would not clear, however, the call was dropped. When I called back in I was told by a XXXX representative that the stop was not completed correctly, as the charge was not an ACH transfer and that it would not be enforced. Upon request I was then connected to a supervisor who told me again that because the stop payment was not entered correctly it would not be enforced - but that I could file a claim with the claims department. I was then transferred to the claims department who said that a claim couldnt be placed and I would have to request a refund from the merchant directly. This now leaves me with a balance that is {$300.00} short of my rent check that was delivered this morning, which means that check will bounce and I will then be charged NSF fees by both CHASE, NA and my landlord causing me even further financial hardships. Had I been notified by the Chase customer service rep on XX/XX/XXXX that the could not put a stop payment on non ACH payments, I could have attempted to make other arrangements for the money, however, due to the failure of the Chase customer service team to properly train their staff on their policies and procedures I am now without any other options.

After spending an hour at the kiosk while the lady selling the product used the demo to straighten my daughters hair as well as mine, I decided to buy them. The demo iron she used worked wonderfully on our hair. She even pointed out how it steamed and it was taking the moisture out of the hair therefore not causing damage. It was supposed to make the hair healthier and not damage it like other irons. I was hesitant at first, but she kept lowering the price and telling me she would give me a GREAT deal. Since the demonstration worked so well I went ahead and purchased the irons. I got home and the next day I washed my hair and used the iron and right away noticed it was nothing close to the one she was using for the demo in the mall. There was no steam and it did n't straighten my hair as fast as the one she used. I went back to the mall and tried to return the products to the merchant and they told me they only would exchange the product for a different one and there were no refunds. Before I bought the irons the return policy was not stated nor was it posted. It was only printed at the bottom of the receipt AFTER I had already purchased it. Red flag right there because most places that sell products will back them up with a guarantee. I explained that I did not want another product that did n't work as advertised. I told the merchant I would be starting a dispute with my bank and gave them another chance to refund my money and let me give the products back. I called my bank immediately and wanted to start a dispute. I waited the time period they told me to before they could start the dispute. They temporarily put the credit back into my account while they investigated. As a consumer it states that if you feel a product is n't the quality that was advertised you have the right to dispute.

( see amount below ) : For the record I called M  T on XXXX  XXXX XXXX and XXXX XXXX and tried to solve the problem. The M  T letter I received was dated XXXX XXXX, 2016. The # is XXXX. Each time I called and spoke to several employees the response was unacceptable. The last person I spoke with was XXXX who identified himself as 'XXXX the Manager '.  Because of these transactions being reversed, this has caused undue stress on my entire family and home expenses. Transactions : All illegally withdrawn on XXXX/XXXX/2016 : {$510.00}, {$510.00}, {$510.00}, {$70.00}. The total amount M  T will reverse are the same numbers and amounts above.  XXXX : Why did M  T credit my account on XXXX XXXX, 2016, when they did not pay the transactions on XXXX XXXX, XXXX? The bank could have just not did anything because I would of not have lost any money, that is, if they did not pull it from my account-right? It looks to me like I am being forced to pay for the illegally transactions, not caused by me, out of my pocket by allowing M  T to revere the credit. Also M  T could not and would not show that the illegal transactions on XXXX/XXXX/16 were not paid which is suspicious banking activity to me. All documents should available for view. I do n't see how the purchase of overseas plane tickets could be reversed! M  T could not show the illegal transactions on my account that happened on XXXX, but was glad to show the credits on XXXX/XXXX/16. ",jhaskins2013@yahoo.com,1

Then when pursuing a refinance in the fall of XXXX, it was discovered that HSBC never filed a satisfaction of mortgage for a HELOC that they admitted was paid off in XXXX.

I expected to hear from the bank with my title information but never did. Today I got a call at work from a repossession company stating my car was listed for repossession by 5/3 Bank for nonpayment of my car loan. I explained to them that my car had been paid off since XXXX 2016. Thankfully, they understood that there was a problem with the bank and asked me to contact them directly and were polite enough to give me the account and contact information that I would need. I called the bank and they claimed to not have my address to contact me although there has been no communication from the bank since I received the payment books 6 years ago. During this time my address was the same until I sold my house XX/XX/XXXX. The US Postal service still forwards mail and no contact was made to me to discuss additional payments that were not included in the payment booklets. They claimed over the phone that I owed the last 3 payments of a 75 month payment plan. I do not recall agreeing to 75 months but they claimed they had a signed contract from me for that period. They quoted this to me without proof, without sending me the paperwork, or giving me notice that anything was late. I did not have this contract with me to review and was required to pay regardless of whether this was true or not because they had already placed a repossession order on my car. I questioned them why send only 72 months in payments and say  This is your last payment '' in the payment book on 72 when they expected 75 and got no answer. It was not a matter of not being able to pay for it. I paid over {$1300.00} instantly today to avoid the car being repossessed fraudulently. As shown in my payment history, I could have and would have paid the payments had the bank not sent a 72 month payment booklet saying the loan payments were complete when they claim more payments were due. I now have late payments claimed on my credit history that I consider fraudulent. Why would a bank send payment booklets with less payments than the loan requires? When questioned about this, the bank would not answer. When questioned why nothing was mailed to notify me of their claimed missing payments they claimed they did not have my address. As stated before, they had my address up until the last payment was mailed and the US Postal service continues to forward mail for XXXX customers.

Also, my account would be closed immediately and a new card was issued and sent to me at that time. Upon receiving the affidavit from Direct Express, I filled out the forms and returned while patiently waiting for my new card to arrive.

8596,"I am writing you to lodge a formal complaint against Wells Fargo about multiple overdraft fees from XXXX totaling over {$9000.00}. I am a dedicated online banker.  Last week, my husband made a purchase on XXXX and the pay pal account was linked to my checking account unbeknownst to him. He alerted me that he made a purchase but was unsure what account it was linked. This alerted me to check my account and I was alarmed that it was overdraft by approximately {$650.00}, so I panicked and transferred from our savings account to ensure nothing else would overdraft causing more fees. I checked my account yesterday and was flabbergasted to see that I was negative approximately {$350.00}. So I did some further investigating on my account and noticed that I was getting an overdraft fee for small items as low as XXXX cents and in the month of XXXX alone I was charged about {$1000.00} in overdraft fees. At this point I called the Wells Fargo Customer Service line and spoke with a very kind representative and she said she could only refund me {$260.00} ( give or take. ) I told her that I completely understood her position but that it would not be wise for me to settle when that would still leave my account overdraft and vulnerable to more charges. She completely understood and then transferred me to another representative with more authority. Again, I was treated very professionally and with kindness. Unfortunately she said she would only be able to refund my account around {$650.00}. Please excuse the estimations as I am going by memory. I told her that was a better amount but that I felt that I had been taken advantage of by Wells Fargo and the new overdraft policies that she said I had opted in? I did further investigating on my account and am so sick right now looking at the fees charged so far this year. They total over {$3000.00}. This was money that could have been used to keep my mortgage current, my student loans current and my credit cards current, but now I am in such a hole that I ca n't see the light.   I believe there was a lot of charges accrued due to the way Wells Fargo drafted items out of my account. And it appears that in XXXX there was a change in the overdraft policies. Between XXXX and XXXX fiscal years was charged an average of XXXX overdraft fees per year and between XXXX, I have been hit with XXXX overdraft fees which averages about XXXX overdraft fees yearly affecting my bank account negatively {$290.00} per month. During XXXX to XXXX, I ran a business and was completely focused on that and neglected overseeing my bank account as needed because mainly I trusted WF and could n't possibly fathom that this was taking place and I was being taken advantage of like this.

8622,"I received a voicemail with a time stamp of XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX from Wells Fargo agent requesting I contact her ( XXXX ) at phone number. I did not notice the voicemail until approximately XXXX that evening. The message stated an unrecognizable phone number. After listening to the message a few times, I attempted to log onto my Wells Fargo account website using my XXXX that I use primarily for online activity. I was locked out, so I decided to go to our local WF branch at XXXX XXXX, NC the next morning, Friday, XXXX XXXX ( beginning of XXXX Weekend ).  I talked with a Customer Service Representative there and explained the voicemail and my problem logging in. I do not remember her name. ( The branch manager, XXXX XXXX should provide that info ). She assisted me in changing my password and I acknowledged that everything looked well by observing my checking and credit card accounts.  I typically manage my credit card and checking account transfers online as well as personal savings accounts. I routinely use the online option to transfer funds from checking and savings accounts to payoff credit cards. The money market account in question was never accessed routinely.  The money market in question was started as a safe storage place for money realized from the sale of our primary home in XXXX, NC the previous XXXX XXXX. I had never set up this account for wire transfer and rarely accessed this account between XXXX XXXX thru XXXX XXXX.  When looking through my accounts on XXXX XXXX in order to accumulate funds to buy property to build a home, I discovered an unauthorized wire transfer had occurred XXXX XXXX for {$9700.00} as well as a {$30.00} wire transfer fee. The transfer was directed to XXXX XXXX XXXX in the name of 'XXXX '. I do not know this individual and have no idea how he or she accessed my account.  I immediately proceeded to the XXXX XXXX branch and was assisted by XXXX XXXX XXXX to initiate a complaint and start the investigation.  Since i did not know and report the unauthorized transfer in the allotted time of 30 days, and Wells Fargo insists this was an authorized transfer of my money to an unknown recipient, WF has denied my complaint and closed the case.  FYI ... .I have been a good customer of Wells Fargo and previously Wachovia Bank since XXXX and have never experienced a problem similar to this.  My Question ... ... .I can only suppose that the phone call from XXXX XXXX XXXX at XXXX was to verifiy that it was actually I initiating the transfer. Why, when I did not return her call did the transfer go forward without my consent?  As well, I was informed that the transfer was completed using an Advanced Access Code which was sent to my phone. I have no knowledge of such a call or message. I have received a history report from my Carrier , XXXX XXXX XXXX, and no record of such call exists on that date.  Still, Wells Fargo Bank , NA considers the case closed and is not pursuing the thief or thieving enterprise who STOLE my money!!! ",schwenk@purdue.edu,0

In order to stop this harassment at my workplace, I very unwisely agreed to have $ XXXX/month payments taken out of my checking account. The original credit card debt was about {$500.00}.  Sure enough, XXXX office took withdrawals of {$500.00} here, {$300.00} there, another {$500.00} there, etc. My bank account, much to my dismay, was completely cleaned out by XX/XX/XXXX. At least XXXX or XXXX checks bounced. My brother-in-law and I then met with a Union Bank officer, XXXX XXXX, in the XXXX, XXXX office in XXXX XXXX. I filed a claim with the bank, and said I had only agreed to {$100.00} per month deductions to XXXX. The Risk Management/Loss Prevention department at Union Bank headquarters in XXXX, XXXX denied my claim, however, as they said I had an oral agreement with XXXX. I expressed much concern over all of the unsigned, electronic drafts that were made to XXXX, even though I had never approved of any of those amounts. My protests were to no avail. I should have hired an attorney at the time, but I could not afford one. It was an extremely painful lesson. I did file an online complaint with the Attorney General of the State of XXXX, but I never heard anything back.  2 ) XXXX XXXX - XXXX XXXX -- I received a new chip and pin debit card from Union Bank XX/XX/XXXX. The card did not work, however. My purchases were denied, and my automatic payments to XXXX XXXX on XX/XX/XXXX and XX/XX/XXXX were also denied, which caused my auto insurance to be canceled twice.

I have an email from the person I sent the paperwork to confirming that they received it and forwarded it on to their operations for account closure on XXXX/XXXX/16. On XXXX/XXXX/16, I logged on to the account to see if the transfer was completed. I noticed I was charged a {$2.00} service fee for the cash portion of the account on XXXX/XXXX/16 I ( which seems acceptable considering the paperwork was just submitted that day ). However, I noticed I was also charged a {$2.00} fee on XXXX/XXXX/16 for the investment portion of the account ( which was never actually opened or invested when XXXX HSA transferred to HSA bank ).

I called XXXX/XXXX/16 and asked why I am being charged fees 33 days after submitting account closure paperwork and why my account is still open 42 days after submitting account closure paperwork. They told me they are about 2 months behind on account closures. This means they are making {$2.00} to {$5.00} a month from who knows how many people that have attempted to close their accounts. This is n't even mentioning the fact that I have lost potential investment gains on the close to {$8000.00} that would be invested at my new HSA account if the money were transferred in a reasonable amount of time.

XXXX XXXX responded and stated  On my last message dated on XXXX/XXXX/2016, I advised of the requirements, confirm you completed them, explained the monthly service fees and advised the following : Please note, all promotions will differ and are targeted to specific account holders during specific time frames ; so if you did not receive this promotion via your Citi credit card statement, personal email, or through U.S mail to your home address you will not qualify for this promotion. We regret if this causes you any inconvenience.  With that being said I regret to advise the bonus can not be honored, your understanding and patience regarding this matter is highly appreciated. '' I am very unhappy that I am now told that Citibank wo n't honor the bonus. I 've had this account open for 5 months, during which I was told twice that the offer was attached to my account and that my miles will post by a specific date ( XXXX/XXXX/16 ). How can they just tell me now, after 5 months, that they wo n't honor the bonus, and only after I reached out to them first? I feel like this is deceptive marketing on their part ( promising a bonus that never posted ) to keep me to continue using their checking account and debit card. ",wang1768@purdue.edu,0

We have been under contract since XXXX XXXX and have been mislead by this company from day XXXX. We believe that there are some serious legality issues with how they list their properties. After reading reviews about this company online, it sounds like they are notorious for listing properties which they currently have no legal claim to ; basically they put these properties on the market before they have obtained proper ownership, and therefore have no legal claim to yet sell that real property. This causes the consumer to have extremely long closings that never should have happened if Linear would follow laws and guidelines stipulating when they can legally list properties for sale. We are now 2 months into closing, and there is no end in sight. It does n't appear Linear has done anything on this file and they have now stopped responding to emails, giving us any kind of update, or even providing me with the contact info of the foreclosure attorney handling our case so that I can reach out to determine when this will be finalized.

I was then offered a vehicle which had just come back in and had not been cleaned or gassed up and would I mind and then I should just bring it back the same way. I told them as long as the insurance company would pay for it that I did not want anything they were not going to pay for. I was assured that the cost of the rental would be the same as the vehicle promised and that meant the insurance company would be fine. I gave them the claim number and let them know the insurance company would not have the rental car formally approved for 24-48 hours and they asked if I had a card to secure it I told them I would give them the card number only if they agree to take {$50.00}. off and return it as soon as claim number cleared. The number cleared within less than 24 hours and I assumed all was well at that time.

Finally, an employee got back to me about my overdraft case via telephone, but the line got disconnected, and the man never called me back.

The bank repeatedly insists I am responsible for this money, even though I did all of my due diligence, informing the bank that the card was missing, that the deposit was fraudulent and should not be cashed. I was treated disrespectfully throughout, and was spoken to in a rude manner every time. ",bbrumfi@purdue.edu,1
9038,"Originally, I opened a single checking account at Wells Fargo. Agents of Wells Fargo then began opening new checking accounts and credit cards in my name, going so far as to move my balances around the different accounts. When I asked them to close all my accounts, they stated they would, but never did. This resulted in overdraft fees, and a huge negative impact to my credit. ",bbrumfi@purdue.edu,1
9040,"In reference to the investigation XXXX. On XXXX XXXX, 2016 at about XXXX. I went into the CITIBANK XXXX on XXXX XXXX to pay {$1500.00} towards the installment loan # XXXX. XXXX XXXX employee of CITIBANK directed me to the ATM machine to help with the payment. I gave him {$1500.00} towards the payment and I also wanted to open a bank account to deposit money I had with me. He assisted me at both the ATM and the teller window and advised I needed to withdraw to open the account. I did not realize until after I came home that he did put the {$1500.00} towards the payment instead only {$840.00}. I would like CITI to investigate what was done with the money. I came in with CASH. There has to be video of the transaction where you can confirm what was done while I was in the branch on that day. If in fact something was done in error then I would like the money to be placed back towards my loan. I am requesting a re-evaluation of the transaction and have this employee questioned. I am providing proof of my transactions as I always keep a record of my deposits and keep the same patterns. I did not understand why he insisted I go to the ATM machine and not do this transaction with the Teller directly. ",lo31@purdue.edu,1

I was promptly informed that I would need my mothers ID as well as mine to do so. I had to return home to retrieve my mothers ' information. Since XX/XX/XXXX I have had Power of Attorney for her and had filed a copy of the document with Wells Fargo at that time. At the time of filing, The bank had their attorneys look over the document to determine if anything needed to be done. My mothers account ( XXXX XXXX XXXX ) was sent up as a checking account and noted as a Trust. I can not be listed on that account as I am a recipient of the Trust, however, the Bank allowed me to pay her bills and expenses for her personal and business activities from there with out question as her Social Security Check and Retirement Checks all deposit into that account! I have been doing this since XX/XX/XXXX.  The ( New ) branch Manager of the bank informed that she had no file of the Power of Attorney and that I was not authorized to get into my mothers funds! I did not have a copy of the document on me and was not about to make a THIRD trip back to my house to produce the document as the bank should have had it on file somewhere!  The manager became quite rude with me and told me that I was committing fraud by not producing the paperwork. I left the bank telling the branch manager that I would simply take our business elsewhere!  A few weeks later I get a visit from the State Department of Family Services investigating me for fraud and even questioning whether I was her son ( our last names are different ). The complaint was filed by Wells Fargo Bank.  Needless to say I showed proper documentation to DFS and the closed the investigation. Contacting DFS and filing a complaint was and is way above the duty of the bank! This caused a lot of stress on me and my mother and was completely unnecessary.

I did do that and the last payment was in XXXX XXXX. In XXXX XXXX, Wells Fargo sent me a confirmation letter that the debt was resolved and my acct was closed. I waited for this to be removed from my credit report for about 6 months. I made several phone calls to Wells Fargo, sometimes hearing a sympathetic voice and a promise to do something, sometimes the customer service people would be very rude. I was told that a resolution is equal to a charge off and  Wells Fargo can leave this as is as long as they want '' I tried using a company called XXXX XXXX with no results on this particular issue.

9052,"I went to XXXX on a mini-vacation. While there, I attended XXXX and one night, I lost, or someone stole, my debit card and made purchases totaling {$2600.00} at various Walmarts and gas stations, the following morning. It took me a few days to realize the card was missing as I was using my XXXX XXXX. When I did, I filed XXXX claims with Bank of America, they are : # XXXX  # XXXX. XXXX is for a {$400.00} ATM withdrawal and the other is for {$2200.00} in bogus charges ( such as XXXX {$970.00} and XXXX {$290.00} charge at XXXX ). Bank of America has handled my claims extremely poorly. They at first refunded me the money and later on with no contact whatsoever they took it all back ( not once warning me that this was possible ), leaving me with $ -XXXX in my account. I have since been charged over XXXX in fees because of this. Since then, I have been trying to prove that I in NO way authorized these charges and that my debit card and cell phone had been taken and used without my consent. They have been extremely unhelpful and I question their integrity. I have been at BOA since 2013 and have been pretty consistent with my banking and ( almost always ) on time with my payments. If you try to fully understand the details of the situation and what occurred, as well as what I was thinking, and the circumstances surrounding the situation ( the timeline ), the non- legitimacy of the charges become apparent. The fact that as of now, I have lost all of my savings and owe {$500.00} ( plus my BOA credit card bill ), while having to pay my {$1000.00} on my XXXX bill, is very unfair. Talking about the specific charges, I went ahead and filed police reports. These are with the XXXX PD. For lost property, this includes the debit card and phone : XXXX and for CC Fraud : XXXX, this includes all fraudulent charges ( including {$400.00} ATM withdrawal ). Bank of America has twice denied my claim ... with no communication on their end as to why. They have not contacted the police and have done very little research on the charges or the facts. This is almost all of my money and it is extremely stressful and unfair. Please help put pressure on Bank of America. This is theft. ",mmaloof@purdue.edu,1
