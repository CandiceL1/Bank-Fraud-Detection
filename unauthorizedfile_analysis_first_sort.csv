1,"I 'm no longer an account holder of SunTrust. I used to be until I realized how unethical of a company that is. Let me explain to you why I believe this : For years, SunTrust advertised and promoted in big letters their XXXX XXXX debit card. With that card, an account holder could earn XXXX mile for every {$1.00} spent ( for debit and credit card transactions ). SunTrust even advertised that they would not put a cap on a cardholder 's ability to earn miles.   Over the past XXXX months, SunTrust must have reviewed their debit card portfolio and what they did as a result of their review is shocking : They closed all account holders who had earned above average number of miles regardless of the types of products they purchased, regardless of the length of their relationship with SunTrust, and regardless of the amount of money in their checking accounts. I know of at least XXXX cases where SunTrust contacted XXXX XXXX to have the miles in the cardholder 's account reversed!!!   SunTrust is clearly engaging in what is commonly referred to as  bait and switch '', a marketing strategy of getting customers to sign up for a product ( that, by the way, carries a yearly fee of {$75.00} ) and then, once a certain number of miles are earned, the account is closed. This is unacceptable and a regulatory violation.   If SunTrust does not immediately stop closing accounts and reversing miles already earned, I 'll notify a well-known XXXX XXXX lawfirm to pursue a class action lawsuit against SunTrust and its XXXX and XXXX individually.

I was told I was notified of this via mail, though no certified letter or any correspondence showing I had received notification could be provided. Upon speaking to a supervisor, no remedy was available other than talk to the new bank tomorrow. I do n't feel I am overstating to say that this  customer service '' is tantamount to theft. Citibank allowed me to deposit my entire paycheck into my account 3 days ago on Friday, and on Monday denied me any access to my money! Like many Americans, I pay for most everything by debit card and rarely carry cash. How can a bank hold a persons money hostage, with no explanation other than I 'm sorry but we sent out letters?

6,"There are two components to the bank fraud that I discovered this morning.  1 ) Wells Fargo changed my corporate bank account number without advising me.  2 ) A customer attempted to send me an electronic payment last Friday via ACH. I never received the payment. After contacting Wells Fargo, they explained that my bank account changed. I then attempted to determine when this changed by looking at the previous bank statements. When I pulled my XXXX XX/XX/2015 bank statement from their online banking system the statement reflected the NEW account number. I then pulled a copy of my XXXX XX/XX/2015 statement from my local drive which I had downloaded back in XXXX. The XXXX statements ARE DIFFERENT. Meaning, that the Wells Fargo Online Banking system is displaying incorrect banking information to their consumers ( i.e. fraud ). It is not clear because no one has investigated this whether this is the result of fraud, weak internal controls in their IT process or some other reason. No consumer should assume that the information they are receiving from Wells Fargo is credible or accurate.   ",dai77@purdue.edu,0

My branch tells me the problem is created on the merchant 's side The most recent occurrence I even called the bank to inquire if I had any outstanding charges against my account that were not itemized and any amounts that were not included in my balance.  I was told by customer service that according to their ledger I had enough money in my account to cash the check to transfer my money to another account for my mortgage payment.  Chase has always been good to me and reimburses the OD FEES, but they limit their customers to XXXX in a one year period, My complaint is not against the bank nor the merchant, it is the procedure that I feel needs a look at.  My other bank, a credit union, does not alter the usable number, all transactions are withheld from my account and the ledger shows a greater total but a lesser usable amount especially if the merchant enters the transaction as charge and not a debit ; my total amount and usable amount even up when all transactions have actually been paid ; this is the fair/upfront way of managing the accounts of the customers.

The next day I got a copy of my bank statement a filed a report with police. I went back to the branch to file the investigation with Tcf bank. The bank said that it would be easy to identify the person because they used tcf bank 's atm and they good camera systems. Next they ask me if i gave my pin # to anyone and I told them no! That I did not give my pin to anyone. Next they ask me if I suspected anyone told them no I do n't and that I had not used my atm card in a while since about XX/XX/XXXX but I had just went through a divorce back in XX/XX/XXXX its possible my ex wife could have got a hold of my card when she moved out and I did not authorized her to do anything with my card if in fact she was the person who stole my money. I told them that I have only XXXX card and no one else is on my account. The person who stole my money done a balance inquiry that cost me {$2.00} then according to my bank account statement and started pulling money out. The money that was taken made me short on my apartment 's rent so I had to move out. I continued to work with the bank asking if there was anything else that I could do the manager said no they have their own investigation department and they would be sending me a credit. I got a credit about 10 days later and a few days later I received a response from the investigation department asking for my account as to what happened and it had to be notarized and faxed back.

The manager said that the investigation was sending me a letter as to their findings but I have not received any letter from them. Then she told me to file an appeal which I done. I do not think that it is fair to accuse me of benefitting from this matter.

XXXX XXXX, XXXX has a 14 year unblemished history of business and financial performance, and as a corporation stands on its own, and is legally considered a  person ''. Their attempted co-mingling of disparate attributes will damage my personal credit score, and are discriminatory against small businesses owing to the prima-facie truth that Chase Bank provision of identical services to XXXX XXXX companies would never include provision of a  date of birth '' and  social security number '' to support running a personal credit report/score. The practice of requiring personal DOB and SSN for provision of small business merchant services is discriminatory against a properly formulated business, represents an unnecessary burden not applied to large entities, and is particularly galling because in the specific case merchant services, contorts the entire process SINCE THE DIRECTION OF MONEY FLOW IS FROM THE BANK ( XXXX ) TO THE SMALL BUSINESS. Given this money flow reality, conducting a personal credit check is not only discriminatory and abusive, but fraudulent, since there is no provision of credit arising from performance of the credit review, notwithstanding the rare circumstance of a charge-back, which for the undersigned complainant has never occurred in 14 years of accepting credit cards. The postulated charge-back scenario is tenuous, since Chase Bank themselves have handled the business banking services for XXXX XXXX, XXXX for approximately 10 years. Furthermore, if charge-backs are the basis for concern, the examination of capacity to reverse fund charge-backs still remains with the legal entity, since it is the business account from which charge-back funding must be captured.

The executive Dept. of Chase bank is claiming they are not required to keep my investment records past 7 years so I just lose my money even though the certificate states automatically renewable and has no expiration date. I am assuming my money is drawing interest all these years as this is the verbage directly on the document. I have been a customer with Chase for over 30 years and have always lived in the State of Louisiana. Contacting me was never an issue. My parents currently live at the address listed on the document. I have attached a detailed timeline along with scans of the certificate, which I hold the original, and XXXX forms. As you can notice on the timeline, this has been a very lengthy process, and I have exhausted every avenue possible with Chase in order to retrieve my investment funds. Chase is claiming that the funds were abandoned since there was no activity however the funds were never turned over to unclaimed property. I am certain that purchasing an investment cd is specifically designed not to be touched in order to achieve maximum benefits which is the reason there was no activity and it clearly states  automatically renewable ''. If indeed Chase did decide these funds were abandoned, what are the guidelines they must follow to turn the funds over as unclaimed and how many years are they required to keep records? Is Chase not responsible for giving me information as to what they have done with my funds I entrusted to them as an investment? Are they allowed to  lose '' someone 's money and not be held accountable?   ",zhao393@purdue.edu,0
65,"I am filing this CFPB action to contest a series of abusive and seemingly unscrupulous actions taken on XXXX XXXX, 2015 by Ally Bank personnel, in relation to my online savings account. I opened up an Ally Bank online savings account last month and deposited a total of {$20000.00} into the account via transfers from my home bank 's checking account.  Other than the slowness of moving my funds from my bank to Ally ( it took 5 to 6 days rather than their advertised 2 to 3 day period ), my experience with Ally was basically meeting my expectations until the events of the past day. I had successfully set up secure access to my Ally account via both their regular online login system and via their mobile phone application.  Two days ago, I changed my home phone number due to the increasing receipt of numerous scam and fraudulent calls, and within hours had gone online and promptly notified all of my financial institutions and other service providers of my new home phone number. There was no change to my mobile ( cell ) phone number, address, or any other information. My updates to my home phone number at all of these accounts, including Ally, were done via the usual secure login systems.  On the morning of XXXX XXXX, 2015 I received a call from a woman on my new home phone number who only identified herself as being from Ally Bank, who said she was calling to confirm an  address change '' that I had recently submitted. She was very aggressive, refused to further identify herself ( I do not have caller ID on my home phone ), and continued to rapidly ask me a very long list of questions. I at first answered the first several questions, such as the last XXXX digits of my social security number, my pet 's name, my mother 's maiden name, and other items that I had offered up as security questions provided by me when I first opened the Ally account, and seemed reasonable. I definitely gave her all of the correct answers. She kept going on and on and on, however, asking increasingly personal questions, such as the make, year, and model of my vehicle, which I have never before been asked, and seemed highly unusual. Since I suspected possible fraud, I stopped answering the questions after about the eighth item, and ended the call.  I then almost immediately attempted to log onto my Ally account to get the account number, and call Ally 's regular customer service line to confirm that the call from this very aggressive and rude woman was legitimate and to ensure that a problem with my account did not exist. After correctly logging in, a message appeared, saying that my account had been locked and that I needed to call the toll-free phone number provided. I them quickly called the toll-free number and after giving the representative my name and account number ( I had retrieved it by then from my print Ally records ), was told that there was nothing they could do, and that I needed to place a toll call to a woman named  XXXX '' at XXXX. After waiting about 90 minutes I finally received a return call from  XXXX in Loss Prevention '' who again incorrectly asserted that I had filed an  address change '' to my account, which I again said was incorrect, as only my home phone number had changed. I then had to answer many more questions from her, and many of the questions seemed extremely unusual and intrusive, such as the make, model, and year of not just my current vehicle, but also of previous vehicles I have had, and places where I have lived many decades ago. Ally Bank 's so-called  loss prevention office '' needs to be held to account for the abusive behavior of their employees, and should take immediate steps to avoid this from ever happening again. The only thing the  loss prevention '' office accomplished in my case was Ally 's permanent loss of a good customer, and this filing.   Thank you for your careful considerat   ",zeng60@purdue.edu,0
66,"My conflict with Bank of America ( BOA ) can be summarized as follows : BOA refuses to refund my account for an unauthorized transfer of {$1300.00} that occurred on XXXX XXXX, XX/XX/2015 despite BOA having actual notice of the unauthorized scheduled transfer on XXXX XXXX, XX/XX/XXXX prior to its occurrence and despite having reassured me that it would not occur at that time. I am pursuing a complete refund. Since the bank has little to no record of my communications, I bring this to your attention in the hopes of impacting legislation so as to improve bank documentation requirements in order to ensure that the right result occurs more timely, efficiently and frequently in conflicts between banks and consumers. Thank you for your assistance.   As a customer of BOA, I utilize online banking. On XXXX XXXXXX/XX/XXXX, I received a suspicious email from BOA informing me that a recurring transfer was scheduled to occur on XXXX XXXX, XX/XX/XXXX in the amount of {$1300.00}. I recognized the payee as my landlord in XX/XX/XXXX, whom I may have paid via electronic transfer but only a few times. I immediately notified the bank of the email. I spent at least two hours on this call. I was connected to the fraud department after XXXX transfers. They found no record of the transaction. They informed me that the email was not from the bank and to forward to XXXXXXXXXXXX, which I can substantiate. They assured me that the transaction would NOT be done and the money would NOT be withdrawn. More importantly, since it was not authorized by me, if the transaction would continue as indicated, I was assured that the money would promptly be returned to me. I asked them to appropriately note my file and send me written confirmation to that effect. As expected, they refused to send me anything in writing, and I later discovered there are NO notes on my file other than that I called on XXXX XXXX, XX/XX/XXXX. That is unacceptable documentation reflecting formal and actual notice of a material transaction.   On XXXX XXXX, XX/XX/XXXX, I received another email reminder that the recurring scheduled payment would be made XXXX XXXX, XX/XX/XXXX which is when I discovered the transaction had in fact been made on XXXX XXXX, XX/XX/XXXX. On XXXX XXXX, XX/XX/XXXX at XXXX EST, I immediately visited a BOA branch to contest the transaction that I was told would not occur. They called the same phone number to which I have access thus demonstrating the uselessness of visiting a branch and working with a banker. I was connected to the fraud department, and I went through the same process. Told that I 'd be contacted soon and have the money returned in 48 hours, no action was taken and no call received by the bank in 36 hours so I contacted the bank again. XXXX transfers later I was finally told that it was not fraud and they would not refund the money ; that it was my fault and I was out of the money.   I informed the representative that I WILL NOT be responsible for an unauthorized transfer because of a software mistake when the bank had actual notice of such prior to its occurrence. I demanded the representative connect me with someone who will help solve my problem. He finally connected me with online and electronic services. They informed me that this was  fraud but not fraud '' as the bank calls it. I said just call it a mistake by the bank. They said the money would be returned whereupon I was connected to someone who had no recollection of that. Repeated the story for the XXXX time and now, XXXX hours after visiting the branch, I have not had my money returned to me and have no reason to believe it will be returned to me in the foreseeable future. Like everyone else who has little time to waste, I have wasted many hours of my time pursuing this matter. I expect to waste more because of the bank 's disjointed and opaque organizational structure. As an attorney, I know my rights and I intend to pursue my rights to the fullest extent of the law.

I was told that the charge had not yet processed so nothing could be done because the charge could potentially fall off rather than be processed. However, I had a new debit card issued in the meantime. On XXXX XXXX, 2014 the fraudulent charge was in fact processed. The charge was made to an unknown person in XXXX. I was in XXXX for my wedding and honeymoon from XXXX XXXX, 2014 to XXXX XXXX, 2014.

I then called Santander to request the documentation used in the claim investigation. It was at this time that I was also asked if I wanted to reopen the claim. I agreed to reopen the claim as I assumed that some piece of information was just overlooked. I was told that the claim results and the documentation would take approximately ten business days, however due to the holiday season and the countless days of in-climate weather that affected postal service, I waited nearly a month before contacting Santander once again.

Upon reviewing the documentation I came across contact information for the merchant who received my {$490.00}. The customer service number provided was disconnected, the email address was non-existent, and the merchant could not be located through any internet searching means. Also in the documentation was information showing the debit card authorization through a XXXX terminal that is listed as a  person to person '' transaction.

XXXX explained that the transaction was in fact  person to person '' meaning that the authorizing party would have to present the debit card to the merchant. The XXXX terminal used is not an online account, it is physical credit card terminal. Due to privacy policies, XXXX could not give me any further information regarding the merchant. I then relayed this information to Santander explaining that based on the  person to person '' transaction, I could not have physically been in XXXX when I was very clearly in XXXX on XXXX XXXX. I also explained that I had n't been able to contact the merchant himself as all of the information provided appears to be fake. Santander told me that nothing more could be done because they do not reopen a claim after it has been investigated XXXX.

At that point, I decided to go into the XXXX branch of Wells Fargo Bank ( XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX, XXXX XXXX ) as that is the closest location to us, on XXXX XXXX, XXXX. I spoke to XXXX XXXX. She did some research and again told me that she could not find any documentation. She escalated this to her Conflict Resolution Department. I received a call back from XXXX on XXXX XXXX stating that there was nothing she could do as they only keep records for 7 years. I asked her for documentation on her findings and she refused to provide any. I asked to speak to her supervisor and I was directed to XXXX XXXX. XXXX again contacted her XXXX XXXX XXXX. and they could find no history of my CD as they only keep records for 7 years. They sent me the letter, the file is titled XXXX from Wells Fargo XXXX XXXX and it is also attached.  I did not receive anything from them either orally or in writing that states that my receipt is invalid, just that they do n't keep records for more than 7 years. I find this to be unacceptable and to be nothing short of a big bank stealing a consumer 's money. Also, I never received a XXXX. I did some research recently and found that they are legally bound to send me a XXXX every year I had money invested in this account. So I feel that there is something more serious going on here. Like a breach of contract as I consider this receipt a contract between Wells Fargo bank and my wife and myself. At this point I do n't feel that they ever invested my money. They just kept it. There is no time limit on the CD other than the maturity date in which they were supposed to re-invest the money until we told them otherwise which we never did until latter portion of last year.  We are taking our money out of Wells Fargo because we will not give them the opportunity to steal more money from us. Really all we want is our money with the interest from the 14 years that we had this money tied up with Wells Fargo bank. And I would like to see them pay for their crime of trying to steal our money and the breach of contract and trying to hide behind the fact that they only keep records for 7 years.

118,"As described in the previous complaint, which was against the CRA itself, it is impossible for me to have XXXX hard inquires waiting weeks apart earlier this year. As explained, Citibank XXXX XXXX, XXXX XXXX, SD XXXX ( XXXX ) XXXX was notified of this error in multiple letters and a phone call. Apparently, Citi thought that a letter or a phone call meant that I wanted another hard inquiry done, which I never gave them permission to do so. It is absurd to think that I would expect a different result within weeks, I merely sent a letter asking for application status, and phoned to also discuss the application and if they received my letter. Because of a possible language barrier, it appears that the citibank customer service agent simply would try to run another hard inquiry. It appears that during this time frame of only a few weeks, my credit score dropped XXXX points. Furthermore, until this is corrected, I can not apply for additional credit with anyone in fear that they will look at these XXXX erroneous requests as a desperate attempt to get credit, probably to be denied and to make the situation worse.

So now 4 weeks later - I find that my checking account accocated with debit card was closed. I contacted chase again and they claimed to have contacted me to let me know but never did. They said the account and card was closed due to the charges I claimed as fraudulent were maybe before the purchase at XXXX.

I had been a member before ; the new accounts person was able to see my prior member ID/access ID. However, when trying to open the checking and savings account, she was unable to. She said it was with their back office and suggested I wait until the back office was able to resolve which would take an additional day. I asked if she could take my deposit. She said she could not until the account was opened. I explained I did not wish to return to the bank to deposit funds once the account was opened, so she suggested I give my deposit to my fianc who was already their established customer. Once the account was opened, she said my fianc could transfer the money from his account into my new accounts.p over the telephone. The next evening she left a message stating the back office was still trying to open my accounts and that she would call me two days later to follow up since she was going to be out the office until XXXX/XXXX/15. My account was finally opened XXXX/XXXX/15 and my fiance transferred my money into my accounts on the same day. While reading about additional NFCU services available, I learned I could obtain a secure loan using money in my savings account as collateral for a much lower interest rate than my credit cards. I applied for such a loan ( share secure ) on XXXX/XXXX/15. I opted to pick up the check at the XXXX XXXX branch the next day. The next day I was not able to come to the branch so I called the loan center asking if they could deposit the check into my NFCU checking account. They talked to the XXXX XXXX branch and were instructed to send the request in writing to their office. They said they would deposit the proceeds that day or the next. The loan center representative relayed this to me and also asked for a good contact number so the branch could contact me if necessary. The next day, I noticed the monies had not been deposited so I called NFCU. After being on the phone for nearly an hour the customer service representative explained I would need to go into the branch. He explained XXXX at the branch said their policy had changed ; they could no longer deposit into my account, I would need to go to the office. That was a problem since I was not near the office and would n't make it to the branch before it closed. I asked to speak to the branch, I was transferred to XXXX. She told me nothing could be done, that I had to go to the branch. After I explained what happened, XXXX put me on hold to talk to the manager. When she returned she said they would deposit my loan proceeds and she would mail the loan agreement to me to obtain my signature. She further asked that I return the signed documents back right away. I agreed, she said it would take 20 minutes for her to deposit my proceeds to my checking account. I thanked her, I had outstanding checks and would not be able to go to the branch. When I checked my account 20 minutes later, I learned all my accounts were frozen. The customer service person I talked to said the branch was closed. When I reached home, my fiance said XXXX at the branch called him asking about transfers he had made to my account. He confirmed the transfers were legitimate and explained he transferred the money to open my accounts. XXXX thanked him and hung up, yet she did not unfreeze my accounts, nor did she deposit my loan proceeds to my checking account. We called the suspicious activity department and was able to speak to XXXX in the branch, but she would not remove the freeze on my accounts and said she would not be able to do anything for me until Monday.

The account became over drawn, which was an over sight on my part. The account was closed. I have been fighting with this for years and BBVA Compass have not been helpful. They never informed me that I was reported to a company called XXXX XXXX Services. The overdraft on my account was simply an over sight. It was no way intended to cause fraud. I went into XXXX of the local BBVA Compass branches and spoke with a branch manager and I was given a print out of when the account was opened and when it closed.

I am not a criminal and I have no criminal record nor do I have fraud on my back ground. I am a law abiding working citizen that made a minor mistake and its costing me dearly. Please have Compass review there records and remove this label from my name. This account was not associated with nor intended to be used in any type of fraud activity. If BBVA Compass truly believe this account was intended for fraud, please prove it. I dont owe them anything. And if BBVA Compass does not want my business, I understand but please dont make it hard for me to move on to another financial institution. This is so unfortunate and these kind of practises are intended to hold back the already middle class to poor. Life is a struggle as it is and with paying additional fees to cash my payroll check or pay for pre-paid cards is really hard on me.

Never told me they reported me to a place called early warning services for the very very old account back in 2009. I have suffered enough.

I was totally unaware that the checks were counterfeit until my bank started closure procedures on my account without notice. When I called them, the customer representatives and Risk Department refused to revoke the decision because I am fully responsible for all transactions and since the money was already taken out, I may be held to repay the overdrawn amount of XXXX-something dollars. They told me that I made transactions on money that was n't there to begin with, but that means that I never had the money in the first place, thus I should not be held liable for it.

They hide themselves behind monotonous masks of  there 's nothing we can do '' and furtively put the blame on the consumer.

240,"Please be advised I have experienced or is experiencing some discriminatory practice from CHASE Banking branch located at XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX, NY XXXX ; from an apparent overzealous loss prevention Manger against myself a XXXX CHASE banking customer/member with no past or previous record of loss or fraud with CHASE Bank or any other Bank for that matter.  Over the years anytime I decide to deposit a check at this particular branch to my checking account # XXXX it is always held up for what amounts to no reason, the process is usually put through loss prevention and fraud faze where I have to wait for an unfair amount of days until this branch / loss Mgr has no more legal right to hold the funds. In other words they do not release the funds willingly or voluntarily even though they have proof there was no misconduct ; there is just no more legal excuse for them to hold on to it which they are then compelled/forced to release funds to customer.  This newest incident started on XXXX XXXX 2015, at XXXX when I deposited a check from a tenant for {$3500.00}. CHASE originally credited me an incremental {$200.00} advanced credit on the deposit as per there policy of funds availability, however the overzealous loss prevention manager reversed this and put the deposit into some kind of fraudulent activity which reversed the incremental {$200.00} credit and cause my account to be overdrawn as I had used a portion of the available {$200.00}.  I have been banking with CHASE for over XXXX years ; I also own a home in XXXX ( XXXX ) and rent to tenants that make direct electronic payments and check payments to this same account during the same time period so CHASE is well aware of this kind of activity to my account.  On XXXX XXXX XXXX, 2015 after receiving and alert on my mobile phone through the CHASE mobile online banking App installed on said phone, that my account was overdrawn, at which point I called CHASE Banking at approximately XXXX, to inquire of the reason for the overdrawn account ; the initial CHASE representative could not figure out the reason why the {$3500.00} deposit was being  Held '' as it is current status indicated on my account. So he connected me to who I believe was a CHASE online banking loss prevention manager by the name of  XXXX '' she was pleasant ; but she could only confirm the reason the check was being held was because  the tenant banked at  XXXX XXXX XXXX '' and was paying me for the very XXXX time '', so therefore the local Loss prevention manager at XXXX XXXX XXXX branch saw a fraud issue with this scenario I 'm supposing.  I asked if CHASE felt there was some fraud why did n't they notify the person that made out the check and XXXX XXXX XXXX, the online loss manager XXXX replied  CHASE does not do that ''. I surmised this local Loss manager at XXXX XXXX XXXX branch would only erroneously assume fraud based on my background of being a minority since I have no criminal history or any fraud issues with any bank ; and that this manager totally disregard common sense and my history of receiving rent payments from various tenants over the past XXXX years on my banking record.  XXXX also advised me I would not get any credit for the deposit until XXXX XXXX 2015, a full XXXX business days after I had made the initial deposit.

After hearing my story, XXXX XXXX told me that although the tellers had given me erroneous information, which he said could perhaps be classified as  bad behavior, '' it did n't meet the criteria of  bank error '' and therefore there was nothing that he could or would do. He  reassured '' me that it was a pleasure to speak to me, and thanks for doing business with Wells Fargo. He hoped I would have a nice day. XXXX XXXX informed me that to avoid further fees, I should transfer {$300.00} to that account to keep a minimum balance, and also to transfer an additional {$4.00} to cover the negative balance and an additional {$5.00} to cover this month 's impending service fee.  I do n't know if the tellers had given me incorrect advice to discontinue the recurring transfer inadvertently, or if they did it specifically to generate fees. It does n't really matter at this point. The fees will total {$70.00}.  Regardless, this is the sort of predatory activity that the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau was designed to combat. As a mere customer, there is little that I can say myself that Wells Fargo will listen to. I know their behavior is wrong, they know it, and now you know it.  Please help make it right.

317,"Capital One has violated these laws, as explained below : Consumer Financial Protection Act, FTC Section 5, Truth in Savings Act, Electronic Funds Transfer Act, Maryland Consumer Fraud Protection Act.   Capital One forced open our safe deposit box and liquidated its contents without notice to us. Through mishandling, they lost the contents. They insisted that they forced the box open because we did not pay the rental fees. In fact, our checking account was set up such that the rental fees were automatically debited from the account each year. At some point, due to a security concern, we changed our checking account number. Capital One failed to link the new account number to the safe deposit box, which is what led to the perceived nonpayment. At no time did Capital One give us notice that there was an issue with the fees, nor did they give us notice when they forced the box open and liquidated the contents.  Our box contained irreplaceable jewelry that my parents purchased for us as wedding gifts from XXXX. As is common in XXXX families, these pieces of jewelry have incredible tangible, not to mention, sentimental value. The box also contained some legal documents concerning my uncle 's estate, which are irreplaceable and difficult to re-execute, considering he lives in another country.   Capital One claims to have sent the property to the Maryland Division of Unclaimed Property, despite that documentation the bank itself provided to me showed that nothing but  miscellaneous documents '' were sent, despite also giving us an inventory showing that the box contained several pieces of jewelry. The Division has conducted exhaustive searches and has confirmed that it never received, nor does it have, any of our property from Capital One. Rather than address the merits of our claim, Capital One has been  searching '' for our property for nearly a year, with no success. We have impressed upon them that the injury was inflicted when they failed to link the new account number to the box and failed to give us notice, but they continue to attempt to shift the blame to the XXXX.   Capital One has further indicated that they do not believe we ever signed up for automatic debit form our account to pay the box rental fees. However, they in fact debited our account for the fees for approximately XXXX years. If they do not believe we had signed up for automatic debit, then debiting our account without our consent constitutes a violation of the Electronic Funds Transfer Act, 15 U.S.C. 1693a et seq., as well as the NACHA rules.   We sued Capital One in federal court on an individual basis. Again, rather than address the merits, they chose to fight us on jurisdictional grounds. This is what prompted us to file a class action in Maryland, to fight for our rights and those of others similarly situated. Ultimately, the bank will have to address the merits of our claims and those of others. It puzzles us that the bank wo n't simply admit that they did something wrong, and chooses instead to force consumers to jump through hoops like this, when it is their own wrongdoing that is in question.   We have attached the relevant pleadings for your review, which contain a more detailed description of Capital One 's offenses.   ",zhan1565@purdue.edu,0

I had to close all of my accounts transfer money, deactivate cards, the whole XXXX yards. My main financial institution is Union Bank of CA, I have been banking with them since XX/XX/XXXX. I can honestly say in addition to my purse getting stolen Union Bank added to my stress with their lack of customer service and concern for me as a customer, and not to mention me still not getting the money that was stolen from my account. I went into the bank sunday afternoon on XXXX XXXX XXXX located in XXXX, CA to open a new account. Prior to my funds being stolen I had XXXX in my checking account and XXXX in my savings. I had XXXX fraudulent charges totaling XXXX which left my checking account at a balance on XXXX and my savings at a balance of XXXX. Because of the fraud I transferred the XXXX to my savings leaving me with a balance of XXXX ( checking and savings total ) and some change. I opened my new checking account on Sunday the XXXX, me and the teller XXXX transferred the XXXX ( available checking ) to my new checking and took out XXXX cash which left me with XXXX ( new checking account ) and still kept the balance on XXXX in my savings. Mind you the XXXX was already stolen so all of this money still is n't accounted for and I 'm still short {$100.00} from bills. After I left the teller I look at my bank account XX/XX/XXXX and see a balance of XXXX in my checking including a credit from XXXX and a deduction from XXXX XXXX and an overdraft of XXXX in my savings and XXXX in my new checking account. So the next step I took was going back up to the bank, I talked with the manager XXXX and he himself was also confused because of what transpired on my account. XXXX proceeded to make sense of my account and turned my savings from a negative to a positive, with the XXXX balance that was available to me at the time. From him doing this that left me with XXXX ( savings ) and XXXX in my checking account because a check was deducted for XXXX. After doing all of this it left my fraud checking account at a XXXX balance because the payments that were pending from fraud had n't posted to my account yet. Fast forward to Thursday I submitted all proper paper work to Union Bank because my claim was over XXXX and XXXX advised me that I would be in contact with the Claims dept. I called and talked with the Claims department and they advised me that I would receive a provisional credit to cover the amount that was overdraft from the fraud charges. Mind you I as a customer am also still at a loss of the XXXX myself, I still have yet to touch the money and no balances have yet credited my new account in the money that was lost to me as a customer.

The account holder then tried to prevent some overdraft fees when the debit card associated with the account was canceled on XXXX XXXX, 2015. There was no documentation to support the need to close the debit card. Then the customer service line was contacted that same day and told the account was deemed fraudulent and had automatically closed the debit card.

458,"Citibank advertised a special promotion for their Citigold product. It required a minimum deposit.   I already had a checking and a savings account with Citi. I added additional funds to the savings account to achieve the threshold amount. In exchange, I was to receive the added benefits of the Citigold product.   Unbeknownst to me, Citi opened a new checking account tied to Citigold. Since I did n't know this account existed, no money was placed in this account. Since no money was placed in this account, it was below the threshold. Citi began charging fees.   I was able to have this reversed and shut the account. However, I think it is important to communicate to the CFPB that Citibank continues to employ deceptive practices even after it has paid heavy fines and made changes to management.

490,"I can not close my deceased uncle XXXX XXXX XXXX 's accounts at Huntington Bank because they will not recognize my unique position. I was Representative Payee, Power of Attorney, Medical Power of Attorney, and Executrix of my uncle 's small monetary holdings. He passed in XXXX 2015 at the VA nursing home. When I went to the XXXX County Courthouse in XXXX, WV in XXXX, I understood in this case that I could just proceed to follow the will without the lengthy probate process. My uncle was never married, no children, no property. All I needed to do as Executrix was pay the bills which I had been doing for years ( my uncle was in the Veteran Nursing Home in XXXX, WV at the time of his death ) and disburse the funds according to the will. These funds by will, were to be divided XXXX ways between his XXXX siblings ( or their families if they had passed first ). This I have done with approximately {$21000.00} of the total approx. {$30000.00} that existed at the time of death. My problem now is that when I went to close the Huntington Bank accounts ( one was VA administered through me, one was personal and Social Security administered by me ) and place the approximately XXXX left at Huntington into the estate account at XXXX XXXX Bank to disburse to the heirs, Huntington froze the accounts. This is not consistent with logic. After Huntington was notified of my uncle 's passing in XXXX they continued to honor my checks in XXXX and XXXX but now they can not? Apparently for some reason, even though he passed, I was authorized to write checks for those months, but now I can not close the account. Had I just written checks, it appears that I would have been fine, but there is some policy in place that prevents my closing the accounts and now I am told they are frozen. This is quite a predicament. I am well past the 30 days from demise for a probate process ; and the bank will not honor any of the means I have to prove that I am the responsible party to administer and distribute the funds. Since I have hit this roadblock, I have made appointments at the courthouse and with an attorney to see if they have any alternate advice, but I ca n't understand why there is not a process at this bank to verify my documents and proceed, as the insurance company and the other bank has been able to acknowledge. When I talked to the VA and the Social Security client services, they supported me in my belief that there should be a way to acknowledge my documentation and the federally appointed position I was in to administer my uncle 's fiduciary interests.  Since this roadblock occurred last Friday XXXX XXXX, I have talked to numerous levels of a number of organizations, even representatives at Huntington Customer Service were surprised at the opposition I was meeting. I was told it is a Huntington WV policy, NOT a WV law, and that the policy was administered by each branch of Huntington, I was even told by a Huntington team member to go to a different branch!  And now that I am being drug into a policy war, it seems, I am submitting this complaint in hopes that a reasonable policy can be put in place for this extremely rare circumstance that I am apparently in and also I hope for a personal remedy for my family.  Furthermore, this situation which is taking enormous amounts of my time, reminds me to point out the inconsistency in which things have been handled to date. Also, I want to point out that this branch was actually at fault for recommending and initiating a bank product for my uncle that a bank examiner voided out. That is why the major part of my uncle 's money was no longer at Huntington Bank in the first place.  Please find XXXX pages of documentation.   ",chen1331@purdue.edu,0

636,"Yesterday I received an email notification that my Wells Fargo account had been overdrawn and I had used my overdraft protection. I was surprised by this email as this account is only used to pay my student loans and I know exactly what goes into it and what comes out of it. I got online to check my account and found almost {$50.00} in fees in the last 3 months and a XXXX balance in my checking account. What surprised me the most was a $ 8 monthly service fee for each month in XXXX, XXXX and XXXX. I have had this account for 8 years ( since 2007 ) and have never paid a monthly service fee because I set up an automatic transfer of {$35.00} between my checking and savings account to waive the {$6.00} normal monthly fee of this type of account. As I checked back through my online statements I found the change happened around XXXX this year where my account must have been automatically  updated '' without my consent or knowledge to an account that now charges {$10.00} a month and the options to waive the fee have changed and my option to transfer to my savings account has been removed. The only options left to waive my monthly fee consisted of having a minimum {$1500.00} balance, having a direct deposit of at least $ XXXX, or having an automatic payment be taken for a Wells Fargo home loan or personal loan. None of these options are usable for me as this account is only used to pay my student loans. I currently live in XXXX and I do n't have the option to go into a branch near me to sort things out so I called the XXXX number and talked to XXXX separate people that both basically said they could not help me at all. The only suggestion they had was to call the branch I opened it at. This morning I called the branch and talked to a banker named XXXX. He was more helpful but overall said that since I live in XXXX and can not physically be there, he could not do anything to my accounts to help me. He confided that I was not the first to call and complain about this change that happened and that apparently this change happened to about XXXX types of older accounts that had been  grandfathered. '' He said they would have sent out a letter at the beginning of the year informing me of the changes. When I stated I did not receive any such letter he suggested it might have gotten lost in the mail or something as it would have been going overseas. I have since checked my letters from Wells Fargo in my filing cabinet and have not found any such letter, though I did find my most recent debit card which would have arrived around that time to my XXXX address, indicating the overseas mailing address is indeed correct. In XXXX we never have problems receiving mail and have a very reliable mail system. XXXX directed me back towards the phone call center which I had previously called, sending me in circles. I am appalled that Wells Fargo can change my account terms and type without my consent and I feel something is not correct here. Can I please get some help and direction in this matter. I noticed that there were some news articles from XXXX this year about a law suit against Wells Fargo in regards to them opening unauthorised fee attracting accounts. I am not sure if my case falls in this same category of incidents but it certainly does n't feel right. Any help is very much appreciated.   ",fische10@purdue.edu,0

734,"On XXXX XXXX 2015 I applied for a checking account with Citibank online. Not sure if I did it right so I applied again on the phone and again on the XXXX online. On XXXX XXXX 2015 I received several letters from Citibank. XXXX of which contained a bank card in each. Great I had the account. I went to a Citibank Atm and deposited {$20.00} which is still in the account at the time this complaint is being filed. I tried to use my bank card and it was declined twice. Once I got home I called customer service who told me there was a restriction on the account and I needed to call new account services. I was also informed that I had XXXX accounts. I told them I only wanted XXXX and gave them the account number of the one in which to keep, the one with the {$20.00}. So just to be exact I am writing this complaint pertaining to the account ending in XXXX. On Monday, XXXX XXXX 2015, I called new account services where I was informed that I needed to send in proof of address. I was told that a cell phone bill would do and I promptly sent a copy of my phone bill to them. I faxed it to the number ( XXXX ) I received from the agent. I called the next day which was XXXX XXXX 2015 to verify that new account services received my fax, they did. Later that day I received a call from a number I did not recognize, XXXX. The gentleman on the line explained that he was calling on behalf of Citibank and he was the XXXX reviewing my proof of address I sent in and he thought to check with me because my XXXX bill had an apartment number and I did not put one on my bank application. I explained to him that it did not matter because I stayed in a hotel and all mail came through the front desk, so I would get it as long as it came to this address, the same one that I gave them on my XXXX bill as my proof of address. He asked if this address is permanent, I assured him it was. He then explained to me that he would have to talk to his supervisor as they usually do n't give accounts to people in hotels. He said he would call me back after he spoke with his supervisor, either later that day or the next. The next day I waited, I did not receive a call so I called new account services. They explained to me that the account was denied by XXXX and I will be receiving a letter soon. I feel as though I have been a victim of discrimination again. Where I live should not play a part in whether I get an account. I gave all my documents as asked of me. I already had the account, they sent me a card, so the only reason for them declining or closing my newly opened account has to do with the address where I live. I am not sure of the reason they put in the letter or the reason they will give your organization but I feel that it should be known that I have the card and even placed money in the account. The reason for them closing the account has to do with the fact that my address where I am a permanent resident is a hotel. I do n't think that people who live in hotels, or shelters, or any residence that Citibank does not agree with should be a reason that a person is denied an account.   ",dai77@purdue.edu,0

806,"I had XXXX accounts with Ally Bank. XXXX was a checking account, which I used for my small business, and the other was a savings account held jointly with my wife.   In XXXX I received a substantial tax refund from the IRS, which I deposited in the savings account. A few days later, I noted that the account had been frozen and I called Ally Bank to ask why. The Customer Service rep told me that my wife and I were suspected of fraud, based on information received from the IRS. As directed by the rep, I called XXXX XXXX ( ( XXXX XXXX XXXX ) of the Loss Prevention Department. She told me that the funds were being sent to the IRS, but she refused to give me any information on which department of the IRS had requested this, who I should contact, or how I should go about getting the funds returned.   After many hours of calling different IRS departments, I finally located the responsible division of the IRS - the Identity Theft Department in XXXX, TX. They told me that, while they agreed I was entitled to the money, they wanted to make sure that I was actually the person who had filed the return and deposited the money. After a XXXX minute conversation, I managed to verify my identity to their satisfaction and they agreed to re-send me the check.   However, the next time I checked on my Ally account, I found that the savings account had been closed. I called XXXX XXXX again, and she was unable to say any more than that Ally had decided to close the account because of the involvement of the IRS. I asked to speak to a supervisor and she transferred me to XXXX XXXX ( XXXX XXXX XXXX ). He told me that Ally could close any account they wanted, for any, or for no reason. I asked him whether he felt that Ally had a duty to act reasonably in dealing with their customers, and he replied that they did not and that they could do whatever they wanted with regard to customer accounts. I asked him who had authorized the account closure and he declined to identify any individual, saying only  the Loss Prevention Department ''. I then asked him for the name of Ally 's primary regulator, in case I wished to make a complaint. He refused to say and suggested that if I had a complaint I should take it to the XXXX. Finally I asked him whether my wife and I could open a new account to deposit the check being sent by the IRS and he said he would get back to me.   Later on he called me to say that Ally had decided to close the checking account as well. Once again he declined to give a reason, said that Ally did not need a reason. Again I requested the name of the primary regulator and he declined to disclose it. Obviously these account closures have caused and will cause a considerable inconvenience to me and to my business. It is shameful that Ally cose to close my checking account in retaliation for my making a complaint.. In addition, I am very disturbed by Ally 's attempts to prevent their customers from reaching the appropriate regulators. Fortunately, I have worked in the financial services business for more than 30 years and so have the requisite knowledge to find this information without Ally 's assistance, I worry that Ally 's behavior will unfairly impede customers without similar experience and thus prevent them from obtaining the redress so clearly required by Ally 's capricious and unreasonable actions.

I logged in today and tried to see if bank send me any notification via their system, but since they started charging me XX/XX/XXXX, I am not able to review any information ( see attached for showing no eNotices on my account ).

However, there is no information what the dormant account means, when it started and what I have to do as customer to avoid this fee. I think this falls into UDaP ( unfair and Deceptive practice ), since bank did not notify customer of charges to the account. Yes, I could have logged in to the account to check my statement but I think with such substantial change of the account terms, there should have been a courtesy letter sent to my home address to notify me. There also should have been better explanation of the charge ( why am I being charged this and what I can do to stop being charged this fee ).

871,"Dear Sir/Madam, I am writing to express my concerns about a behavior of Scottrade Bank and their affiliates which may have adversely exposed my personal information and lead to identity theft and fraud.   Specifically, in going through my records in order to better understand how I could resolve ongoing identity theft, I discovered that when applying for a bank account at Scottrade Bank, Scottrade Bank improperly handled a number of documents which had very personal information on them. The actions of Scottrade Bank not only broke from the current standards of data security but also broke Scottrade Bank 's internal policies regarding handling customer information.   Specifically, on or around XXXX XXXX, 2013 ( XXXX Time ), XXXX XXXX, a regional manager from Scottrade Bank offered to receive Scottrade Bank account application documents via email. Email is a notoriously insecure medium of communication yet XXXX XXXX allowed and offered to receive the documents via email, despite the fact that it was against Scottrade Bank 's internal policies and does not have any of the normal safeguards in place to handle personal customer information. The XXXX XXXX, 2013 email contained PDF attachments that included my full name, signature, address, bank account numbers, Social Security Number, and other very personal and sensitive information.   As is clear by Scottrade 's online disclosures and policies, Scottrade Bank states that it will never transmit customer information over email and or ask for or receive personal information via email, however, XXXX XXXX, a manager at Scottrade encouraged me to send the information by email to expedite the process, with no disclose of the security concerns.   I am writing today to ask Scottrade to explain, in a public forum, why they let my personal information be transmitted in a way that puts me at significant risk to identity theft. I would also like to know what the current status of the email and personal information is, has it been deleted, has it been accessed, are emails records secure, who could have gained access, was the email accessed via HTTP or HTTPS, was it confirmed a secure connection?   The actions of XXXX XXXX, put me at my personal information at risk and could have likely been the direct cause for hackings that happened weeks latter and accounted for over XXXX of fraud.

Afterward, I asked to get a copy of all the documents that I signed, and I was told that I could not have the copies. It was explained by more than XXXX employee, including the manger of the branch, that the policy forbids that they release those  internal '' forms to me. I explained that as soon as my signature was required, and I signed the form, that whether they considered them  internal '' or not, I was entitled to copies of my own documents that contained my signature. 3+hours later, I was told that the district manager would contact me, which she did. In the meantime, and since that time I still do not have copies of the forms that I signed, even though I requested them at each step.  1. I have asked or a copy of the policy or policies that explain ( s ) the bank 's position on refusing to provide copies of forms signed by a customer of Capital One to said customer after he signs them.  2. Though I was repeatedly told at the branch that this is  the policy '' I have been given no straight, unequivocal answer as to whether such a policy exists ; nor have I been told that the bank will provide me with that or any other explanation as to why their address forms or any other documents which contain my signature may not be provided to me.  3. I have been told that, according to the  office of the President '' of Capital One bank, and  XXXX '' who works in that department, that  there are no disclosures '' that delineate the policy regarding the bank 's refusal to provide copies to the client of forms he just signed, but that any details about such policies as well as whether they exist is an  internal '' issue.  4. The answer in # XXXX is an example of the doublespeak and equivocation that I am describing :  no disclosures '' in my understanding means no approved public material that the bank will release to explain their policy. That does NOT answer the question as to whether the bank is taking the position that they flatly refuse to make copies of a client 's signature and give it to him as part of ANY FORM that he signed.  5. Another example is when I was told that  if I want help from '' the office of the president that I 'm going to have to be specific about the  documents that I am requesting. '' I told them that  any form that has my signature on it '' are the forms that I am requesting in my particular case, but also:6.

945,"Around XX/XX/XXXX or XX/XX/XXXX, I banked with Wells Fargo in XXXX, Az. I had checking, savings, and credit card accounts. I was a college student and my tuition status changed from out-of-state to in-state and so the amount of my financial aid checks significantly increased. At this time, I thought it would be a good idea to try to build credit history by putting a number of charges on my credit card and then paying it down when I received my next financial aid check.  However, XXXX semester, after I had made a large payment from my checking or savings account to my credit card account, I noticed there was still a lot of money in my checking or savings account. I went to the Wells Fargo at XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX, AZ XXXX and asked a bank representative where this money came from. I was told that since I had made a credit card payment that far exceeded the minimum payment, some of my payment was put back into my checking or savings account. I did not complain or ask that it be reapplied to my credit card account.  At the time, I was not aware that cash advances carried a larger APR than purchases. It was some time afterwards that I realized this and recalled this incident. In XX/XX/XXXX or XX/XX/XXXX, I began requesting from Wells Fargo credit card and bank statements from that time period around XX/XX/XXXX to XX/XX/XXXX. I do not recall exactly when the incident had taken place and, after examining the statements, I still could not narrow down when this cash advance had taken place. At this point, I had been paying interest on hundreds of dollars of cash advances.  It was around this time that I noticed that my credit card statement no longer showed a balance for cash advances. To this day, I have a XXXX balance for cash advances.  I have been hesitant to bring up the whole issue with Wells Fargo for fear that the cash advance balance will return to my credit card. I do not know how much interest I paid over the years for the cash advance balance so I do not have a dollar amount that I am looking for in compensation.  Also, Wells Fargo has asked a number of times if I would like to close the credit card account and open up a line of credit at a lower APR. I have been hesitant to do this as well, as I am unsure if that will erase any records of all this.  Like I stated above, there is not a dollar amount that I am looking to be compensated. My intention in writing this is to inform a regulatory or consumer protection agency of this incident, in case it has happened in the past or is still occurring, and to find out if, by closing my credit card account and opening up a line of credit, it will somehow erase a record of these issues.

I brought up the issue that they did not even advise us the money would be taken out and it was n't done right away and she said they would work to make process better but there was nothing they could do to refund the money. I also brought up the child support issue and they advised there is nothing preventing them from pulling from that either, that only social security and XXXX are protected. At best this is unethical but I do not believe the right to offset includes automatically taking child support so it borders on being illegal. The account that we have is based in Maryland which usually has much better consumer protection laws than surrounding states so I believed that they need to also provide notification before taking any money from account, not that they did n't have right to non-child support money but have to at least provide notification prior to taking it.  There have been additional issues in the past. XXXX in particular I have a large issue with is I wrote a check on the XXXX of a month. I did not see it post or even show pending until the XXXX. When it posted on the XXXX it actually posted on the XXXX. I had paid some bills early on the XXXX since I got paid and check did n't even show up against account yet. Luckily I had enough money in the account to cover anything but them posting an item that does n't show up on account at all until the XXXX for a back date seems highly questionable to me. PNC advised this was a standard practice and that you just have to account for check once it 's been written. I understand what they are saying but at same time if I see that something is n't even pending on account I should be able to use that money without fear of something being back dated on account. The only reason I paid bills early on the XXXX is I was getting paid on the XXXX so I knew money would be in there before anything else cleared.   ",afrances@purdue.edu,1

Upon opening up the account I informed the bank teller that there was a previous fraudulent activity on my account back in XXXX.

I resolved thus case years ago when it happened to me.any they finally took the check and I asked them if I can get money now because I have to put some money down on my car deposit they told me yes.they explained to me that I will be getting an account called the opportunity account so I agreed to that and asked one more time to make sure there was nothing in the system saying I owed any money at all she said I was fine.. so my account was setup I left for that day. I went to another branch the next day and made a withdrawal of XXXX dollars to pay the remaining balance on my vehicle, set up online banking etc.. so everything seemed good until I went to dinner that night and the temp card that they gave me did n't work at all!

So I called wells Fargo and they told me that that card had been closed out and that they were not sure why and to go to my local branch in the morning. I was very frustrated at that time but said ok I 'll do that ... so the next morning I went to the bank to see what was going on. I waited an hr to be seen. I went to the front first and they stated I need to speak to a banker, I waited and waited and finally was able to see one. So when I sat down I told her what happened and she seemed very apologetic and said they is weird and that should not have happened and that she would issue me a new temporary card.

She said nothing ...

So she let me speak to the lady on the phone.. I 'm literally crying at this point because all I could think about was my children and my daughter 's birthday coming up ... so the lady told me on the phone that they have to review my account etc etc I told the lady that that 's MY MONEY and it was n't me that did that years ago and I need my money out this account now I won thst money In a settlement everything if legit!

I asked the agent to hold onto the check until I had received a refund from the other policy, and she has kept the new check on her desk. But in the meantime, Wells Fargo debited my account for the {$2300.00}, causing the account to go into overdraft and impose a {$35.00} fee. When I complained, WF reversed the overdraft fee and explained that this type of payment is debited from the customer 's account on the date specified by the customer when the payment is ordered, but that the payment is not forwarded to the recipient until the check is cashed. The representative had no answer for why this should be different from the procedure with a traditional check. In my view, the bank is not at risk in this transaction, because it could simply refuse to clear the check if there were insufficient funds in the account, as it does with ordinary checks. I feel the process is designed to increase the odds of an overdraft for which a fee can be charged.

1162,"I signed up with a credit counseling agency to get my debt under control. One of the agency guidelines was to closed my current checking account and open a new one so debtors could get access to my account while the agency was undertaking negotiations. I paid the balance on my checking account to XXXX, and opened a new account with the same bank ( USBank ), and started my automatic paycheck deposits to that new account. But when I paid the balance to XXXX, on my old account, USbank did n't close the account because of pending transactions. I called the service support line and they informed me they could n't do anthing about it until the balance came to XXXX. Because I had several payday loans out, and the bank continued to try and process them as the payday loan companies continuous kept submitting payment request to the bank, the account always had pending transactions. Also, I used USBanks bill pay service. I changed all my bills to be paid out of the new account I opened. The bill pay service continued to try an pay some bills through the old account even though I had cancelled all payments from that account, which led to return check fees. During all this time the returned check fees added up to over XXXX dollars. The bank took over XXXX dollars on my new account to pay those fees. That XXXX dollars was my mortgage, home insurance and car insurance payment. I was not able to make those payments that month. I called the bank branch directly and the person I talked with put a hold on any further incoming payment request which allowed me to finally close the old account. So why could they not do that ( put on a hold ) when I initially paid the balance to XXXX in order to close the accout? With another call they refunded me XXXX return check fees of XXXX each, but said they could n't refund the rest because I did n't call earlier. But I called there service support line twice and each time was told there was nothing they could do. I live paycheck to paycheck and losing over XXXX set me back on many payments on multiple accounts. I cancelled my registration with the credit couneling service because after 30 days after registrating with them, they still had not started negotiating with my creditors, and I filed chapter XXXX bankruptcy. I was trying not to file bankruptcy, but with USBank confiscating over XXXX dollars in return check fees plus the XXXX dollars in fees I paid to close the old USBank account, I did n't see any other way to get my debt under control. I feel USBank could have put a hold on processing any other payment request to my old account when I paid it to XXXX. I then could have referred those debtors to the credit counseling agency I signed up with to negotiation settlements.   ",pearson9@purdue.edu,0

At that point in time I realized I was not going to be able to make it to another TD Bank branch by the cut off time of XXXX XXXX, to avoid being charged several overdraft fees. So at that point in time I called TD Bank 's XXXX customer service number and after waiting for over half an hour, I was finally connected to a live TD Bank customer service representative. I explained what had happened and that same TD Bank customer service representative told me that I had nothing to worry about as long as I made the deposit at another TD Bank branch, on that same day, before XXXX, and he assured me that he was going to note my checking account so if by chance I did receive any overdraft fees, they would be instantaneously reversed/refunded due to the malfunctioning ATM, which the TD Bank customer service representative clearly and endlessly kept referring to as a bank error. So the next day on XXXX/XXXX/15, I received {$140.00}, worth of overdraft fees so I called TD Bank 's customer service XXXX number back and I explained my situation, especially the note that had been placed on my checking account the day before by the another TD Bank customer service representative, to the new TD Bank customer service representative that picked up my call. After reviewing my checking account, the new TD Bank customer service representative told me that the note never mentioned, authorized or suggested that any overdraft fees should be reversed or refunded. So I quickly requested to speak to a supervisor. So after going back and forth with the TD Bank customer service representative and supervisor and also after they both, together, reviewed my checking account several times, they reversed/refunded the {$140.00}, worth of overdraft fees. But they stated to me that it was being done as a courtesy and that 's why I 'm filing this complaint. It should 've never been labeled, noted, called, referenced or posted in my checking account 's notes as a courtesy reversal/refund, it should 've been labeled, noted, called, referenced and posted in my checking account notes as a malfunctioning ATM bank error.

1177,"To Whom It May Concern : Please be advised that the filing of this complaint with the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (  CFPB '' ) follows a summary complaint filed with the Office of the Comptroller of the Currencies (  O.C.C.  ), without supporting documents, and is intended to notify Bank of America (  BofA '' ) of my intentions to pursue litigation for unfair and deceptive banking practices as it relates to recording bank transactions ( i.e. backdating banking activity ) in an effort to charge additional overdraft bank fees. I 've incurred these overdraft charges as a result of either a broad and systemic bank issue or the bank has intentionally levied fees against me in the wake of a successful consumer lawsuit against the bank. The lawsuit involved a consumer credit reporting dispute against Bank of America involving the Fair Credit Reporting Act (  FCRA '' ) to which the bank was found negligent back in XXXX XXXX in the XXXX District Court of Massachusetts.  The following provides a summary explanation of banking activity involving a primary checking account and XXXX bill payments processed through the primary checking account that evidently occurred between XXXX XXXX and XXXX XXXX of XXXX. Bank notifications supplied by Bank of America call into question the sequence of the XXXX bill payments as well as the accuracy of the primary checking account 's balance on XXXX XXXX, XXXX which the bank controlled and therefore relied upon to charge the overdraft fees. The sequence of these XXXX bill payments and the resulting overdraft fees is neither consistent nor supported by customer notifications initiated by the bank to indicate recent bank activity and the primary checking account 's balance ( s ).  The primary checking account that my wife and I hold with Bank of America had a beginning balance of {$41.00} prior to XXXX bill payment transactions that Bank of America has reported as occurring on XXXX XXXX, XXXX. [ See Exhibit XXXX ] A payment to my wife 's XXXX XXXX account was scheduled to transact on XXXX XXXX, XXXX for {$30.00} through the bank 's online payment web portal. On XXXX XXXX, XXXX, I received an email notification from Bank of America indicating that our primary checking account balance fell below the {$25.00} pre-determined amount that was set by the customer to notify of low balances. [ See Exhibit XXXX XXXX The email notification indicates that the primary checking account balance of {$41.00} had decreased to {$11.00} as expected following the {$30.00} XXXX XXXX payment.  On the following day XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX XXXX, I received another email notification the primary checking account had become overdrawn. As the bank explains, the overdrawn balance was the result the {$30.00} XXXX XXXX bill payment as well as a bill payment for {$180.00} to XXXX. [ See Exhibit XXXX ] Based on the documentation and statements provided by Bank of America, I contacted their customer support center on the evening of XXXX XXXX, XXXX to dispute the overdraft charge on the XXXX XXXX payment and to request a refund of that overdraft fee. [ See Exhibit XXXX ] The explanation by the bank representative as well as the notifications and statements do not support the processing of the {$180.00} XXXX payment first. First, Exhibit XXXX clearly indicates that a {$30.00} transaction occurred to change the primary checking account balance from a beginning balance of {$41.00}, to {$11.00}. [ See Exhibit XXXX ] Secondly Exhibit XXXX clearly indicates the {$30.00} XXXX XXXX payment first in sequence as evidenced by the transaction number ( s ) indicated in the bank 's document. Finally, Exhibit XXXX shows the same sequencing of payments with the {$30.00} XXXX XXXX payment first in order.

Before signing the contract, the BOA representative who opened the account stated there was a Buyer 's Remorse period during which I could return the unit without fees anytime before the beginning of the first lease period, which was XXXX/XXXX/XXXX. He also indicated in multiple phone calls that my processing fees were 1.69 % plus XXXX cents per swipe for XXXX and XXXX, 2.13 % plus XXXX cents per swipe for XXXX XXXX, and a XXXX cents flat fee per swipe for all debit cards. He stated that there were no other fees and these were the lowest in the industry such as when compared to XXXX, which has a 2.75 % flat processing fee for all card types. He also stated that holding an active XXXX XXXX account would waive the monthly fees on the Business Checking account held with Bank of America. I agreed to these terms and received the unit. However, I was not satisfied with the experience, and wished to return everything before the lease began. On XXXX/XXXX/XXXX, I contacted my BOA representative and he told me to contact XXXX XXXX. I contacted XXXX, who told me my lease had already begun on XXXX/XXXX/XXXX and I would be responsible for paying nearly {$3000.00} to pay off the lease even if I returned the device. I called BOA back and told my representative, who was shocked and stated that the lease clearly should not have begun until XXXX/XXXX/XXXX and that he would speak to his manager about doing a buyback to resolve the issue. The buyback was approved, and I shipped the device to BOA with XXXX overnight shipping. However, on XXXX/XXXX/XXXX I noticed a withdrawal from my checking account for the amount of {$62.00}, labeled lease payment.

In addition, the statements are complicated and designed to be confusing and difficult to reconcile. Finally, I was also charged a {$29.00} monthly fee for my Business Checking account, which was supposed to be waived.

1252,"To whom it may concern : I opened a Wells Fargo Everyday Checking in XXXX 2016 online as there are no branches near where I live and my son ( an existing Wells Fargo customer ) told me that there was a promotion that Wells Fargo was running.

1445,"To Whom It May Concern, I am contacting you regarding a matter from the 2015 tax season. I was unable to receive my refund last year due to issues with my bank processing my return. I should start by bearing some responsibility for this mishap but due process was not followed by the Bank to fix the issue.   Last year I filed my taxes and opted my tax return be direct deposited into my Bank of America account. I gave my correct account number, but mistakenly provided my routing number for incoming wires instead of an electronic routing number. Because of this error, my tax return was unable to be deposited into my account. After about waiting a month for my return, I contacted the Comptroller of the state of Maryland and was told that my return has already been sent to Bank of America. I proceeded to contact Bank of America but they informed me they had not received any transfers and could not help me. It should be noted that I called and visited centers of Bank of America multiple times early on and I was told by multiple representatives that they could n't help me and to check back with the state. I even put representatives from both Bank of America and The Comptroller of Maryland on a conference call, but they were unable to find a solution.   Bank of America told me that if I gave the incorrect routing information, the transfer would be denied and returned immediately. The state told me that no money was returned so they could n't reissue me a check. The state helped me by giving me a trace number for the transfer ( XXXX ). Bank of America used the trace number to track the funds but could not locate its precise location because their records in the wire department  ACH department are deleted after three months of the initiation of transfer. The money has not been returned to the state and the tracer shows that it was deposited somewhere in Bank of America. I have talked to banking center managers and I 've talked to the bank ( XXXX XXXX XXXX ) of the comptroller who has provided me with more than enough evidence ( Trace Numbers ) showing that they have sent the money to BOA and it was never returned. Bank of America has told me they no longer can help me with this issue and to not contact them again regarding this mishap.   I am filing this claim not because I need the money ( Even though being a XXXX student, it would certainly come in handy ). I am filing this claim because it is a matter of principle. I ca n't be forced to accept the bank loosing my hard earned money because of some  Technical Deficiencies ''.   I should note that the Federal Return was processed correctly. The money from the IRS was returned by Bank of America and I promptly Received a check in the Mail four days later. I do n't understand why the same thing was not done for my Maryland return.   I am frankly appalled with the way my bank has handled this situation. From treating it as a  Non Issue '' from the start, to then coming around and blaming me for not contacting them earlier ( even though they have records of me calling multiple times to inquire about my funds ). At this moment my tax return is somewhere in Bank of America, and I would like the CFPB help me find it.   ",atellito@purdue.edu,0
1446,"A bank ( BoA ) incorrectly listed me as having late fees on their credit card which appeared on my credit report while applying for a loan. I had pulled my credit report prior to applying for the loan and it was not on the report, it was applied sometime within 30 days of applying for the loan. I 've never had a BoA credit card so I knew it was not mine. I attempted to dispute directly with BoA but they were difficult to deal with. After multiple attempts and much frustration I finally found someone who would check the account referenced on the credit report. BoA confirmed the error and stated they would notify the XXXX reporting firms. Within 60 days I received a letter stating BoA considered the issue 'closed '. I am dubious and frankly concerned. My loan was questioned due to the incorrect reporting on behalf of BoA ; BoA offered little to no assistance in correcting the error ; and I can not obtain my 'free ' credit reports to measure whether the 'error ' was in fact removed as I had pulled my reports earlier this year. So how does one verify for free that errors were removed? It would seem that if a letter is received from a bank/firm allegedly stating the  issue is closed '' then a consumer should be allowed to obtain free verification of their credit report at the cost of the bank/firm that made the error.  Why are banks/firms allowed to report 'errors ' yet there is minimal responsibility on the banks/firms to correct even when presented with evidence? The check and balance is not there. Consumers are left to fend for themselves sometimes unknowingly that a bank/firm is reporting erroneous information. As a side note, BoA offered no apologies. Only a statement of 'an error '.

1474,"My son, who is military, has had an account with USAA for 8 years and has never had any kind of issues with his banking or payments. In fact, he was an exemplary preferred customer in excellent standing. He also had his vehicles insured with USAA. He even bought his house thru USAA.  Recently, there seemed to be some unusual activities in and out of his checking account, over a span of a few days ... but nothing was brought to either my son or myself ( his POA ) with regards to these activities being fraudulent or reason for concern.Based on the nature of these occurrences, this should have been an obvious RED FLAG with the bank. Instead of putting this thru to their Fraud Dept., and/or issuing a temporary freeze on the account until an investigation was completed, they decided upon themselves to completely and without notice or warning, NOT to do business with my son any longer and restricted access to retrieving any information about the account altogether.  I happen to be a XXXX person as well as a XXXX XXXX, and I have been pursuing this matter on my own trying to find some kind of logical explanation. These were clearly fraudulent transactions and was not treated as such.  USAA is not a real financial Institution as a normal bank would entail but they are an Investment Corp. They do NOT have branches or locations for walk in service except for the one here in XXXX, TN which is close to XXXX XXXX. I went there personally on XXXX/XXXX/16 as I was told on the phone that they are not able to speak with me since they no longer do business with my son - which came as a shock to me. I informed them that I had spoken with CFPB as well as OCC about this situation and in doing so, managed to get a copy of the checking account statement which made absolutely NO sense to me as nothing was specified with all the charges racked up by USAA. There is so much more to explain after this. While being put on hold on the videoconferencing for over 10 minutes, I immediately got a call from someone on my cellphone who indicated to me that SHE would be the one handling this matter and gave me her name and direct number to communicate with her. Today is XXXX XXXX and I have never received a response from her even after leaving several messages each day. I have brought this to the attention of CFPB previously but have not filed an official complaint since I was under the impression that they were in the process of resolving it.  This does not seem to be the case as they have embarked upon a most unacceptable action that is affecting both my son  I in a very critical way. They have confiscated my son 's BAH, since he is in college under the Post XXXX GI Bill, and seems to be applying the full amount wired by The VA ED Dept. into his account, to all these fraudulent and made up charges by USAA. I can not get answers from anyone as the customer service people are very limited in whatever information they are told to give me.  I am my son 's dependent and have no other income to live by. I have been asking about the auto insurance and still can not get answers from USAA. I have explained that my son was not a beneficiary of any of those fraudulent deposits and withdrawals- if any - and his personal information may have been compromised as he had no knowledge of these activities. The bank even accepted fraudulent checks made out to third parties with USAA checks - not once, but twice. Yet, nothing seemed to be of concern to forward these transactions to the Fraud Dept, if, in fact, there is such a dept. with USAA.  There should be a law against this kind of mishandling and negligence with the banks and People 's Federal Funds wired to their accounts as income. I am going to inform the VA of this as they have NO right to interfere with Federal Military Deposits.  PLEASE HELP ME HERE. THIS MAKES NO SENSE AT ALL XXXX Thank you.

1488,"I signed up for and began using a new US Bank checking account in XXXX XXXX. I was mostly pleased with the service. However, recently, I have noticed that I am being charged fees that I did not originally agree to when I signed up for services. I have contacted US Bank regarding these illegal fees, and they have chosen to ignore my messages.   To prove my point, I have uploaded images of the account sign up process, including all account agreements and pages wherein one signs up for an account, opts out of  overdraft coverage '' and enrolls in the  overdraft protection '' service. I uploaded the contents to a website currently under development, XXXX Such a comparison is probably too nice, however, because XXXX XXXX actually disclosed his fees in the agreement fine print ; US Bank, however, did not.   Inside the overdraft section of the account agreement it states :  ATM and Debit Card Overdraft Coverage : Certain accounts are subject to a consumer 's election/choice to opt-in to receive ATM and Debit Card Overdraft Coverage. '' ...  If you do not opt-in, we will not authorize payment of an ATM or everyday ( non-recurring ) debit card transaction that could result in an overdraft status. In limited circumstances, your ATM or every day debit card transaction may be processed and your account results in a negative available balance, even if you have not opted-in to overdraft coverage for these transactions. These situations may include, but are not limited to, debit card transactions that post that are processed by the merchant when the merchant does not first obtain an authorization from U.S. Bank. If this situation occurs, you will not be charged an Overdraft Paid Fee for paying the transaction if you have not elected to Opt-In to ATM and Debit Card Overdraft Coverage. '' The  overdraft solutions '' section of my online account has always stated that I have been opted out of  overdraft coverage '' this entire time, yet they have charged me several overdraft paid fees for ATM check ( debit ) card transactions.   Reviewing the entire account agreement does not reveal that the account owner must pay a {$36.00} overdraft paid fee ( when fully Opted Out of overdraft coverage and opted into overdraft protection ) for ATM and everyday check ( debit ) card transactions. The  overdraft protection '' section in the account agreement does not state that enrolling in  overdraft protection '' automatically enrolls one into or overrides the account owner 's  overdraft coverage '' choice, either.   After signing up for an account, if one  opts out '' of overdraft coverage and signs up for the  overdraft protection '' service ( XXXX ), they are led to believe that doing so will completely avoid {$36.00}  overdraft paid '' fees for ATM and everyday check card transactions. Under the  Overdraft Protection '' and  Opt-out '' columns in the  How much does it cost? '' ( XXXX ) row, no {$36.00} overdraft paid fees for ATM and everyday check ( debit ) card transactions are mentioned. It does, however, mention such a fee in the leftmost  Opt-In '' column for overdraft coverage. It is reasonable to infer that US Bank specifically chose to avoid mentioning the {$36.00} overdraft paid fees for ATM / debit card transactions in the  overdraft protection '' column as doing so would most certainly deter a large number of people, including myself, from signing up for the service.   However, avoiding mention of these fees is certainly illegal as they are not outlined anywhere during the account sign up process, account agreement or  overdraft solutions '' section.

I have a BOA checking account used exclusively to autodraft my monthly interest payments to the BOA payment center for this loan.   I just learned today that the autodrafts were stopped and my loan is in foreclosure. No one at the branch bank could explain this. They put me on the phone with BOA mortgage, which then sent me to the foreclosure department, where was told that a Reinstatement Letter was being faxed with my amount due on it, and that i would have it in 1-2 hours, and then could obtain a cashiers check from the my BOA branch, which they could overnight. After that I would have to call and write several other people to get my credit reinstated and the attorney fees and late fees returned to me. This took 90 minutes on the phone while in my branch office The fax number I gave was my branch managers number.   When I returned, I was told no one received a fax. I had to call the Foreclosure department again, who this time told me it was impossible to get an amount to pay them for three days.   The underlying facts are : I have the money in my BOA account. I never stopped the autodrafts. No one at BOA can explain how they stopped - not even their technical support division. No one at BOA will ALLOW me to pay them. And, they have found a way to add unknown late fees and attorney costs - while destoying my creditworthiness to all - without my knowledge and while I was enrolled in their system to make all payments promptly.   ALL of my recurring payments - XXXX mortgages, utility bills and alarm monitoring at XXXX properties in XXXX states, etc. are handled using automatic drafting because I travel for months at a time and am not present to make payments or to receive mail.

On Monday, XXXX XXXX, 2016 I received an E-mail from Wells Fargo advising that the loan was available.  3. I logged onto my account only to find that {$6300.00} had been removed from my savings account, but THOSE funds nor any other funds had been made available to me. So they were holding my own money and I could n't access it.  4.

I understand he is the assistant branch manager and trust me, he needs to be fired.  5. XXXX XXXX not only DID NOT want to assist me with solving the issue, he was insulting and would not let me ask questions. Every time I tried to say anything, he would begin talking over me.

On Tuesday a.m., XXXX XXXX, 2016, I was at the branch when it opened and requested that the loan be canceled. I asked XXXX XXXX to put in writing that he was canceling the loan as requested. He refused to do this. I left the bank not knowing whether he would actually do as asked or just bury the paperwork and leave me floundering. I think that IS exactly what he would have done if I had not gotten other people and posted comments on social media.  7.

They needed to transfer me to the debit card fraud department, I was disconnected during the transfer.

When I finally spoke with the representative, they were rude and disrespectful - accusing me of trying to commit fraud.

As it was a pin number transaction ( I have the card in my possession ), they told me it would be longer to get the money back. After waiting several days for them to send me the paperwork which required me to respond in a short time frame, I immediately sent the paperwork back along with the police report that I had filed.

Now my automatic payments out of the account are not going through, even though I made sure there was money in this account. I ca n't seem to get anyone to give me the same answer twice. It seems as if they are intentionally holding the money even though it is clear that there was fraud on my account. There were false comments put on my account, such as I was traveling which was untrue. They told me to go to a bank to get the documents faster but when I got to the branch they could not help me. It seems as if they are intentionally giving me a run around. On top of that, I am not convinced that a bank representative could not be working with the criminals.

The customer representative informed me that the total amount stolen from me was {$870.00}. I was told that a form would be sent to me that I needed to sign for them to start an investigation. I had the option of signing XXXX in person at a local branch of the bank, but between my work hours and taking care of a baby at home, I was unable to make it in to a bank during their hours of operation. I waited patiently for this form to arrive in the mail, but it never did. A few days after I made the original claim, my husband found my debit card in our house. I called to inform Huntington of this odd update in the case. The customer service representative informed me that this information would help them in the investigation and that someone could have made a duplicate card.   On XXXX XXXX, I received a letter stating,  We have completed our research into your error notification regarding the transaction ( s ) and have determined that no error has occurred. Please see below the information that was found during our research : +Debit card not reported lost/stolen prior to XXXX XXXX, 2015 +Debit card present at the time of transactions +Frequent history at merchant location ( s ) +Debit card used after transactions in dispute +Transactions made within vicinity of your residence, place of business, normal shopping locations, or you were in the merchant 's vicinity at the time the transactions took place. '' This letter also states the amount of money totaled {$850.00}, which is not the amount the customer service representative had originally totaled. These statements prove to me that their research into this theft was not thorough. Many of the transactions were made at businesses that I have never shopped at or even heard of. There were transactions made both near my residence and in other surrounding towns that I had not visited. Although some of the transactions were made locally, this should n't matter. A thief most definitely has the ability to purchase goods near my place of residence.   Some of the other reasons for the decision are just do n't make sense.  I am not sure what  Debit card present at time of transaction ( s ) '' is supposed to mean.  debit card used after transaction ( s ) in dispute '' could mean that I used the debit card that was still in my possession since it was never actually stolen or I may have overlooked a transaction in reporting the unauthorized transactions.  With a little more thorough of an investigation, they would have likely found that the signature on the receipts would n't match my signature and that security cameras at the places of business where these transactions took place would show someone else making those purchases, not me.  I have contacted Huntington every day since receiving the letter denying my claim with little help in resolving the situation and I my bank account is still short the funds that were stolen from me. I have been waiting for over 2 weeks! There have been times when I have only had {$800.00} or so in the bank and I would have been in extreme financial hardship due to the bank 's inability to fix this problem quickly. Every time I contact Huntington, I have been told an investigator would call or email me by the next day at latest, but have yet to talk to an investigator.   ",fische10@purdue.edu,1

Citibank 's competitor charges less and I would like to have had the chance to switch to another bank before the fee went into effect. Citibank has also made it next to impossible to avoid a fee on this account ; it requires in part a monthly bill payment using its  online bill pay '' system. However, none of the companies I work with, including cable companies such as XXXX or my utility provider are set up on its system. It simply does n't recognize them as companies. Other companies do n't exist at all. Its obvious the product was oversold ; since those other companies have their own payment sites, Citibank 's bill pay system does n't make sense, especially because it does n't work. For example, to send a payment to XXXX, Citibank 's online bill pay needs up to a week to print and mail the company a paper check. The money is deducted today but does n't show up in XXXX 's system more than a week later, since they need time to process a paper check.

My XXXX mother in law asked me if I could go into the Wells Fargo bank and get change for a {$20.00} bill, as we had just dropped her dog off at a 'cash only ' groomer ; to which she did not have correct change for.  After observing the line and unable to quickly identify available seating for her, I sat her in a seat at the XXXX outside of the entrance, then I waited in line until a teller became available. The XXXX teller I worked with advised me he could not change my {$20.00} bill, unless I held an account with Wells Fargo.  I returned to my mother, and explained what occurred. She quickly handed me her ATM card, proudly stating that she has an account from her many years of service with Wells Fargo ( recently XXXX retiring, due to her XXXX only a few years earlier ) and asked me to return, while she continued to wait in her seat. I returned the bank, to wait back in the line as I was instructed. When a teller called me over, I presented the Well 's Fargo card I was asked to, so I could get change for my same {$20.00} bill. This teller appropriately asked for my mother in law ( as it was her account ), to which I advised she was near by, but was sitting as she is XXXX. The teller again reiterated that I would be unable to get the change unless I personally held an account with Wells Fargo. I then asked the teller if I was account holder with the bank would I be able to use the same {$20.00} bill I was presenting to obtain change? The teller advised me that she could, without issue. I then asked if my money held any value to them, being that I am not a current member of the bank. The teller clearly advised me that it does not. I then asked for her business card, as I was not happy with her explanation of the value of my money. I was receiving treatment as a XXXX class citizen, who 's money holds no value outside of the Wells Fargo. A XXXX teller quickly intervened, and advised me the same - that my money does not hold any value in his/the banks eyes, unless I personally have an account with Well Fargo. He then provided me his business card, as I left.  Are these deceptive practices in place to manipulate the public into opening accounts with the bank?  Would these same policies apply if I was a 10 year old child, who saved money in my piggy bank, and wanted to feel as an 'adult ' by placing a {$10.00} bill in my wallet, instead of carrying a change purse? I understand that I am not a 10 year old child, instead I am an adult, who holds many bank accounts at multiple other institutions, who was just simply trying to assist my XXXX mother in law as requested.  Luckily, I was able to go to the XXXX ( where my mother in law was sitting, as there was not seating clearly available for her at the Well 's Fargo branch for her to sit ) and they graciously assisted me in obtaining my change without any confrontation.  I found it entertaining that as we were leaving the store, I observed a young child ( about XXXX years old ) with his mother, asking the man servicing the XXXX XXXX machine outside of the bank entrance, if he could make change so that he could by a small trinket from the vending machine. The man at XXXX XXXX quickly accommodated the child, unlike Wells Fargo was able to accommodate me because my money according to the teller 'has no value '.  The name of the XXXX teller I worked with ( who in clear direct terms advised me my 'money holds no value with the bank, unless I hold an account with Well Fargo.

I asked them how they determine which one is more important and I was told by bank manager that they go by the higher amount in determining which one is more important.

After my father 's death, none of the assets of the trust were administered correctly. WF concealed the disposition of some of the assets until we were forced to go to court to see what happened to them. Despite evidence proving complete mismanagement by WF, XXXX XXXX of the XXXX, MN ruled in favor of WF and levied {$35000.00} in court costs against the beneficiaries for questioning where the assets went. WF had an obligation to inform the beneficiaries of the asset distribution. WF has consumed most of the assets of the trust through negligence and inappropriate charges. Beneficiaries have received {$.00} on the dollar, 5 years after my father 's death, with little chance of seeing more. {$800000.00} of my parents ' XXXX XXXX have either been consumed or will likely remain unavailable. XXXX XXXX has grossly overcharged the trust by repeatedly  reviewing the file '', with no benefit to the beneficiaries as specified in trust law. The property manager, XXXX XXXX, repeatedly blamed the beneficiaries for Wells Fargo 's failure to sell the home despite Wells Fargo owning the assets of the trust. We are on our XXXX trustee. XXXX XXXX was appointed by XXXX XXXX. XXXX XXXX has spent the money in the trust, destroyed the garage and shop by refusing to remove excessive snow, causing a roof collapse, and completely neglecting the property by not maintaining or even mowing the lawn. He has provided no documentation of expenses. He collected an insurance payment for the damage that I discovered in XXXX XXXX. Neither XXXX XXXX nor the realtor had checked on the property since the roof collapse in XXXX of XXXX. To date XXXX XXXX has not had the destroyed garage removed from the property. It has been impossible to market since the destruction occurred in XXXX XXXX. XXXX XXXX also refused to remove snow in the winter, thus preventing any realty showings. He has violated every fiduciary responsibility of a trustee. I wrote to XXXX XXXX XXXX begging to get rid of XXXX XXXX and asking that I be made trustee. My father 's will designated me as personal representative in the absence of WF, but XXXX XXXX ignored that. In response XXXX XXXX said that the communication was ex parte and demanded that I file motions with the court. Why would I expect a different response than the completely inadequate XXXX that we got before? We are stuck with a trustee who has broken the law in destroying our property, and with a judge who is in charge. We have been prohibited by XXXX XXXX via court order from contacting XXXX XXXX who is in charge of the destruction.

He recontacted me a month later saying that XXXX XXXX had  blown him off '', and that he had heard nothing further from him. He then said he was no longer interested. XXXX XXXX could scarcely have been any more incompetent at selling the home, his main purpose as trustee.  When I have explored other websites to report WF 's mishandling of the trust I was discouraged by the requirement that the issue had not been addressed in court. Clearly, WF is familiar with using courts to their advantage. Although we had been told initially that the hearing was an  evidentiary hearing '', it morphed into a trial with a trial attorney representing WF. The judge applied different standards to WF than to us.   ",kprzybor@purdue.edu,0

1761,"The loan system of TD Bank is very confusing. I was rejected today by TD bank to waive the late fee after my best effort to correct a late payment situation. I then realized that it is TD Bank 's deliberate intention to create this confusion to make extra profit by collecting late fees on customers. For a {$2400.00} tax escrow late payment, TD charges {$160.00}, which is 6.54 %.   Almost all other banks I have dealt with either send a coupon booklet for XXXX month payments or mail a monthly statement consisting of both loan and escrow payment. In contrast, TD Bank mails out XXXX separate statements with XXXX payments due monthly. The XXXX is the escrow statement every month around XXXX and due on the XXXX of the following month while XXXX statement is for interest and principal payment around end of the month and due on the XXXX of the following month. Meanwhile TD requires the borrower to maintain a checking account for TD 's direct withdrawal.   Ever since I had this loan at the XX/XX/XXXX, I have always made my payments on time. I usually set auto pay for the ones with coupon booklet. For those which do not send coupon booklet, I rely on their statement to pay my mortgage because the annually changed tax escrow amount. However, the past XXXX, for whatever reason I did not receive XXXX credit card statements and TD 's escrow statement on time. As soon as I was aware of the lateness, I contacted XXXX XXXX, my account manager from TD Bank. He advised me to pay personally at one of their branch. So I did and also established the auto transfer to my TD checking accounts according to my best estimate. From my track record, XXXX waived my late fee and interest immediately after I explained, but not the TD Bank.  Before TD turned down my request, XXXX XXXX arranged a meeting with me and expressed that TD will need more business to exchange for this waiver. At the same time he also agreed with me that TD 's XXXX a month loan statements are inefficient and confusing.  When I followed up with XXXX XXXX on XX/XX/XXXX, I was told that his supervisor rejected it because I have no potential profit to them. I am shocked that a world known bank would handle situation only based on interest instead of fairness and principle. I have been a manager in real estate business for XXXX years, never paid a late fee. All US banks small or large are very reasonable. They base your track record and allow you at least XXXX time late payment leeway. Nevertheless, the TD Bank refuses any refund for the bewildered system uniquely from all others regardless if you have been a good customer so that TD can easily earn the extra profit whenever an oversight happened. The late fee of {$160.00} was only for the lateness of the escrow. I wonder if I would be end up with another late fee of {$170.00} based on the same 6.54 % calculation if the XXXX part of payment which is for interest and principal of {$2700.00} was late. As a reference, I have a similar amount of loan with XXXX XXXX XXXX, its late fee for both loan and escrow is only {$87.00} per month.

Instead I received an  attempted deposit '' receipt with the phone number, XXXX to call for assistance. I spoke with XXXX or XXXX people associated with US Bank that weekend, and they assured me that they could n't do anything to retrieve my money, but that the machine is reconciled on Sunday nights and Monday morning, the situation would be handled.   On Monday, the story changed. Then, I was told that the machine is reconciled on Monday night, and the claim, which can take 10 days to  credit '' my money back to me, could only be filed on Tuesday. The branch manager said she would do me the  favor '' of crediting me the {$200.00} on Monday, which she did. However, I do not think anyone considers it a  favor '' to be given one 's money back. She also threatened that if the machine reconciled without the {$200.00}, I could face overdraft fees when they debited their  favor '' back.   The bottom line is that I have been lied to and still have no clear idea of when US Bank will concede that their atm was in surplus of my {$200.00} CASH. ( The manager did not return my phone call and left early, perhaps for XXXX activities - I had to call again to get a teller to file my claim ) I also am aware that the atm has a camera that records the transactions. So, any reasonable client friendly institution would be able to SEE the cash being deposited, be able to count the extra money, and be able to deduct that I was indeed truthful in my claim.  I am complaining about the timeframe involved with this banking institution 's responsibility to return money due to the errors or mistakes of their equipment. We all know they make money overnight, and now they have taken the opportunity to use MY money to do so, without offering me any recompense. Their behavior is nothing short of thievery.

The bank would return a payment due to insufficent funds on one day/ charge a fee and then the next day approve the payment and charge an additional overdraft fee. This continued for serveral months. This caused large financial issue with my checking account. To the tune of having been assessed from XX/XX/XXXX to present a total of {$2500.00} in overdraft fees all to which have been paid. I have direct deposit and with each deposit the bank is paid for the fees in advance. In XX/XX/XXXX I was billed a total of {$770.00} in overdraft fees, XXXX {$210.00}, XX/XX/XXXX over {$200.00}, XX/XX/XXXX {$200.00}, XX/XX/XXXX {$140.00}, XX/XX/XXXX {$480.00}.

I was advised that someone would contact, I would get a telephoen call, would return the call and leave a message on their machine and receive no call back. The merchant in the past has done several things that indicate questionable business practices. For example during all of the fee assessments, there was an attempt for a merchant : XXXX, they were trying to collect on a late return of movies or no return. This merchant does get preauthorization with the initial rental. So when the movie is returned late or not at all they will go back into the credit card account used to rent to collect payment. I have recorded proof of a balance that was owed that the merchant attempted to withdraw {$60.00} ( approx ) with all of the fees I did not have enough. Ultimately, I only had {$11.00} ( approx ) in my checking account. The merchant miracously authorized the exact dollar amount. Then on the date of my deposit they come back into my account for the difference. I never contacted the merchant regarding the with draw or the authorization of a specific amount to resolve a balance. I was not aware that I had one with them assuming my children returned all the movies. The way it is discovered is that my account is impacted. The bank is double dipping and in the month of XX/XX/XXXX I suspect they were attempting to meet an end of the year quota, impact as may patrons during the XXXX Friday purchase/etc. I have been within the bank and heard that discussion. Also, I have had an incident where my account was compromised/debit card. Off of XXXX attempt with my card for a transaction out of the country they blocked my card. I was told I had to get a different checking account number. I proceeded via telephone and then went to the nearest branch facility and collected a new card. The branch of complaint.

She explained that there was nothing that she could do about the {$400.00}, but that she could sign up for the promotion that would have me recieve a {$300.00} incentive. After that phone call I went in to the PNC branch, again, on XXXX XXXX to see if there was anything that could be done what happened. I spoke with a consultant who told me that there was nothing that could be done about what I was previously told about being eligible to recieve {$400.00}. He then told me that I was not even eligible to recieve the {$300.00} promotion that I was signed up for. The consultant told me that the only incentive I was eligible for was {$200.00}. After discussing my issues and frustrations he just told me that nothing could be done and that this was the best that he could do. A few days I called PNC to ask them when I would be recieving my money and the representative told me that I was not eligible to recieve the {$200.00} or any of the other previous incentives I was signed up for. She said that she needed to contact the PNC branch to further review everything and that I should be recieving a call from the assistant manager by the end of the business day. I still have yet to recieve a phone call.   ",kprzybor@purdue.edu,0

The manager said that would be the only way to get the money back, which was really upsetting to hear the only way to get my own money back would be to do something illegal.Their system constantly tells me I have available funds, and I can not use the card for weeks and it will then change the amount available ( no newly posted charges will show either to explain those charges ) their fraud dept STILL has n't sent me any paperwork I needed for a fraudulent charge.

1871,"I was recently notified of a bounced check that I had written several weeks ago. I had been following my account online as well as the ATM. Upon looking over my account I have found that I in fact did have the funds available at the time the check was submitted to the issuers account. According to B of A I had several holds and money that was being processed according to them. I had made XXXX online purchase with XXXX and XXXX Restaurants equipment and supply 's. Both of there sites agreements say that my card will not be charged until I have received the items in expectable condition. Well from what I see on my account history is on XXXX I made on online purchase with XXXX. At that time they told me they just needed my Debit Card to verify the funds are available but that I was not going to be charged. So there is a processing charge on my B of A account and the money was removed from my available balance. Then the next day, same amount again processing and removed. This went on more then XXXX times until XXXX. It was not until then that the items were received. I contacted XXXX and they said the would be now charging my card. How my Bank could allow multiple holds and processing makes no sense. It has alwasy been my understanding that a hold will fall off in XXXX days if it is not first collected. Yet B of A allowed this to go on every time it would fall off they would either resubmit it or allow these companies to go against our agreement of XXXX hold to make sure that the funds are available. Not every couple of days for XXXX weeks. So apparently it was then explained to me when I called B of A that Checks are the last thing they allow to be processed and removed from my account even thought this is a checking account. So at the time the check was processed I had XXXX in my account but only XXXX was availbale do to all these processings and holds they allowed these companies to resubmit or took it upon them selves to do. So in turn I was XXXX dollars short on this check. I have proof that something very similar occurred awhile back and even though I have no overdraft on my account they allowed the funds to be removed even though I did not have the total avaible balance and put my account XXXX dollars. Why they treated me XXXX way XXXX time and another the next makes no sense. Not to mention we were traveling out of XXXX for a XXXX on XXXX. I had checked our funds prior. Yet at that time the XXXX process had dropped off and gave me a total of XXXX available. Well 2 days later they resubmit this XXXX charge and lionsdeal charge to the put me at XXXX with these companys being allowed to rehold my funds over and over again. This makes it very difficult for me as I am following what the company told me regarding not being charged until the items are delverd in good condition. Yet what I am seeing is banks are allowing these companies to remove money from your account for as long as they want. So when the hold falls off my bank resubmits these holds the next day or several. There is no rhyme or reason. The when I asked them why my check would n't have priority over some hold that has been removed XXXX times prior I was told that they had priority over any check. This in not right. So it is my understand that a business can hold funds and the bank will set those aside over and over. Yet I cant ask them to do this for a check. Not right. I write a rent check to this person every month for years. It is my most important bill. How I can not do what these business do on my own account makes no sense. Then I asked B of A why they did this as I have never bounced a check in over XXXX years. They said I should check my account more. They told me they do not call customers or put checks on hold as they do online. After speaking with my family who are with B of A I believe they are not following the rules.

1899,"In XXXX, I purchased a mobile home in XXXX XXXX, Louisiana. The home was originally financed, and subsequently paid off ( in approximately XXXX, as my own credit report does attest ), with XXXX XXXX. After submitting the final payment to XXXX, I did receive the paperwork and placed it as well as the cancelled check used to pay the last payment into safe keeping with my mother, because I was in the process of moving from the mobile home and into another house. Notwithstanding my naivety, that mobile home being my XXXX ever home purchase, I was ignorant to the fact that I alone was responsible for requesting that the lien be released, and no such instruction existed with the paperwork from XXXX. This did not become an issue until this year ( XXXX ), after laying either dormant or housing an occasional relative, a prospective buyer approached me, cash in hand and offering to buy it. Having no use for it and its age starting to show, I agreed on the spot for a mutually fair amount. Since I knew I owned it free and clear, I consented to the buyer moving it and we agreed that he would receive the title as soon as I could obtain the paperwork from my mother. Well, during the course of the deal, my mother 's apartment complex building burned to the ground, due to an electrical short per the Fire Marshall. Long story short, the  safe '' filing cabinet, and all but a few photos, was among the items that turned to magma by the time the blaze was brought under control and extinguished. However, in Louisiana, mobile homes are recorded with the DMV, because, since they can, in fact, be reverted back to a vehicle of sorts and possess a XXXX. Therefore, I went to my local DMV and requested both duplicates of the registration and title. It was at this time that I learned that the lien was still listed on the registration, and that until it is removed, a title can not be issued for the home.  Finally to the point ; to my surprise, it was NOT XXXX XXXX listed as the lien holder, but Bank of America, with whom I had never even dealt with regard to my home. I tried to contact the XXXX office in XXXX, MS , because that 's the address the DMV had on file, but that office had been liquidated. Then, when I contacted XXXX center, they had no previous record of the mortgage or it was  archived '' and unobtainable, and they recommended I contact BoA, which I did. BoA reps were very rude this time, and every instance thereafter, almost blatantly unhelpful in trying to help me resolve the issue. The only half-way useful information they have rendered, to date, is that my mortgage was likely acquired with thousands of others from GTF, and that it just happened that I had already made my final payment GT, who provided my docs, but that BoA actually had gained the asset.  BoA, upon running my social in their system, they concluded that they had never heard of me or the property, or it was /drum roll ... .ARCHIVED, and unobtainable, stating that if all I had was the registration and ID and that it would be insufficient documentation ... so, good luck with that ... bye! So, I called the FDIC, who instructed me to go to a BoA branch, with my registration, and have the manager place a call directly to the lien release department for BoA.  About a month ago, I visited the BoA branch in XXXX, TX, as instructed. A supervisor agreed to and did place the call in my presence, and three weeks ago was the last time I heard from the XXXX contact. I totally believe I am being avoided if my number appears on the Caller ID. The FDIC then forwarded me to a comptroller, who forwarded me to the top of BoA ( again rude and unhelpful ), and then to YOU as a backup plan.

1903,"Hello, I was a named party in a class-action suit against a former employer. My attorney was able to reach an individual settlement for the named parties, and I received XXXX checks for my share of the settlement. I deposited the checks into my personal checking account with Wells Fargo via ATM, and within the next week my account was locked as the checks were BOTH reported  confirmed counterfeit '' by the issuing bank ( XXXX XXXX XXXX ). This was back in XXXX. I called my attorney, and he checked with the other named party, and their checks went through just fine.   I tried to have my attorney tell the defendant to cancel the checks and issue new ones. Well, it turns out that my bank ended up collecting the money from the checks even though they were confirmed counterfeit. So the defendant refused to issue new checks, since the money was withdrawn from their account. Fair enough.   My bank refused to listen to me. I brought in the settlement documents, I called and spoke to the Manager 's Manager 's Manager 's Manager, still no luck. According to them, the defendant 's bank is STILL calling the checks counterfeit. They claim that the funds are in the process of being recalled back to the defendant 's bank account. Meanwhile, the settlement checks were reported onto my IRS transcripts, so I had to file an extension on my taxes until this whole thing gets resolved.   Here 's my issue : Since XXXX, I 've lost my checking account, my savings account, and the few hundred bucks that was in my checking account when I deposited the checks. My auto insurance payment bounced, and then I had to pay that on the same paycheck as my car payment, and it took some time to recover. The funds are STILL in the process of being recalled, but I 'm still over here floating in the wind. Is there any way I can get this resolved? Is the defendant liable for these ( admittedly minor ) damages over the past five months? I do n't even care about suing for these damages, I really just want to get my proper settlement checks and resolve this issue for good. My attorney claims that there 's nothing more his firm can do to help ( he got his check ), but he suggested that I might hire an attorney to file a breach of contract claim against the defendant.   I believe that the checks were reported counterfeit because the ATM faded out the ink on my larger check. I 've attached printouts of each check from XXXX 's own computer system. I 've also attached a copy of my attorney 's check, which is from the same account as my larger check. I 'm unable to make any progress with either bank, and I would rather not have to take any legal action.   ",atellito@purdue.edu,0

1973,"The issue is that JPMorgan Chase own travel site at ( chase.com ) for members lists fake fares and when the booking is made it automatically switches the prices to a higher level. Enclosed please find the message to Chase Executive Office that was originally not responded to. Also the company insisted on verbal communication and not email which is indicative of systemic issue rather than isolated one.  There is a problem with your vendor that performs flight reservation service on behalf of Chase for its members. Yesterday and today I attempted to book a ticket to fly XXXX and to utilize my accrued points total ( +/- XXXX ). Any time I would select the available rate that lists the flight in $ XXXX range that is listed as available I got a message in process of booking that the rate is no longer available and listing exactly the same flight at on average {$300.00} higher rate. For example the flight departing XXXX XXXX on XXXX XXXX : XXXX XXXX, XXXX XXXX ( XXXX XXXX ) - XXXX, XXXX, Return XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX XXXX that was offered as available for {$810.00} has automatically been re-selected during the booking process into {$1200.00}. FYI, I checked the XXXX XXXX site for that flight and it lists the fare at {$810.00} with exactly the same itinerary leading me to conclusion that the mark up is your vendor 's travel commission.   This happens with EVERY {$800.00} range flight XXXX days before XXXX XXXX and XXXX days after XXXX XXXX that is listed as available after that date. Why is then Chase site listing fake pricing on flights that it has no intention to honor and it bait and switches people in process of booking?   I travel extensively internationally and since I often use booking sites such as XXXX, XXXX, XXXX, XXXX and XXXX I have never seen any fare being made suddenly unavailable in process of booking and rescheduled at the higher rate. I think that Federal Laws specifically prohibit games such as this as airlines are under legal obligation to list all fares including all applicable taxes and fees to prospective consumers, no exceptions.  I would appreciate if Chase addresses this issue to make sure what happened to me does n't happen to anyone else and to honor the rate it has on its site or stop offering the travel services altogether.

1976,"This is the XXXX complaint that I have filed against Capital One Bank during the last 57 days. For information regarding my initial complaint, which also involved my Rewards Money Market account ( hereafter, RMMA ), please see Case XXXX ( hereafter, Case XXXX ).   A brief summary of the facts associated with Case XXXX will facilitate CFPB 's understanding of my current complaint:1 ) After making a {$230000.00} deposit to my RMMA in XX/XX/XXXX, I had, as of XX/XX/XXXX, not received reward points for the month of XXXX. Historically, Capital One Bank credited reward points to my RMMA within the XXXX five days of the new month.   2 ) When I contacted Capital One, they cited a  bank wide system issue '' as the reason for the delay in reward points posting to my account, a claim reiterated in a letter, dated XX/XX/XXXX, that I received after this issue was resolved.   3 ) This letter also stated that the computer issue lasted from XXXX XXXX - XX/XX/XXXX. Note that Case XXXX was actually filed two days after ( XXXX XXXX ) the computer issue that effected RMMAs was resolved. Yet reward points were not posted to my account until ~ XXXX XXXX and Capital One backdated this posting to XX/XX/XXXX.   4 ) Finally, I know another individual who has a RMMA and he/she received his/her reward points during the XXXX five days of XXXX ( Note XXXX, below ). This fact appears to be inconsistent with a  bank wide system issue '' - if the issue was  system wide, '' presumably all RMMA accounts were effected, right?   Onto my current submission:1 ) On XX/XX/XXXX, I received an unsigned, undated notice from Capital One Bank informing me that my RMMA was being closed.   2 ) The notice did n't quite put it that way : instead, it stated that my ability to earn rewards points in my RMMA would end on XX/XX/XXXX and that the funds in the RMMA would be swept into a High Yield money market account in XX/XX/XXXX.   3 ) I received this notice 53 days after Case XXXX was opened. Retaliation for contacting the CFPB?   4 ) This notice arrived after a period ( XX/XX/XXXX-XX/XX/XXXX ) in which I had redeemed a high number ( Note XXXX, below ) of rewards points ( XXXX ). Possibly, Capital One 's attitude towards RMMA holders is,  Please, send us your money, because if you do then you 'll earn reward points (! ) but if you actually use a lot of these points in a short period of time, well, that will make us sad and we will close your account in order to foreclose the possibility of future sadness.  In terms of outcomes, I would prefer to leave my funds in my RMMA and continue to earn rewards points. Hence, I have XXXX questions for Capital One : 1 ) Are all RMMAs like the one I hold being closed on XX/XX/XXXX? 2 ) If not, then why, exactly, is my RMMA being closed?   Note 1 - I omitted this information from Case XXXX because I had not received permission from my friend to include it in that filing. Understand that my friend 's points posted the XXXX five days of XXXX - they appeared in his/her account during this period. In contrast, my points did not post until ~ XXXX XXXX and were backdated to XX/XX/XXXX by Capital One.   Note 2 - By  high, '' I mean relative to my perception of my annual spending on my Capital One Visa, which runs around {$16000.00}. A brief explanation is required : the rewards points referenced above are earned in a money market account offered by Capital One Bank. I typically transfer these points to my Capital One Visa rewards account, where I use them to offset travel ( airline tickets, hotel ) purchases.   ",fische10@purdue.edu,0

I only worked at this job for about a year and then closed the checking account, as I did not work there any longer. I have since moved to the XXXX area in XX/XX/XXXX and have never heard a thing from U.S. Bank since closing my checking account 8 years ago.

I had absolutely no idea what she was talking about, as I did not have a US Bank card to my knowledge.

We have been banking with a local credit union for many years and a few years ago that there would be additional benefits to having another bank, so we opened a savings and checking account with a small branch of Wells Fargo, located in a XXXX store. We did notice when opening our accounts that the WF branch had  NO SECURITY '' what s ever. The Teller cages are in the open and banking clients are seated side by side and required to discuss their private and personal financial matters while being subjected to sharing a closet like room with the bankers and WF clients. This is totally against FDIC rules for privacy and security. We 've brought this security and privacy issue to the officers at this branch and they tell us that the WF home office is working on a plan, but this dialog just keeps going on year after year. My wife and I work with a WF assistance vice president/personal banker. We 've had the recurring problem, that Wells Fargo will manipulate our accounts, allowing them to charge fees for what they claim to be insufficient funds. They even charge fees to transfer OUR FUNDS from savings to checking. In seven days XX/XX/XXXX the stole a total of {$82.00}. When we went into the branch to discuss this issue with our WF ass't VP/personal banker, at which time she left this closet office, where my wife and I are standing shoulder to shoulder with other banking clients. She returned with a woman we had never seen or knew and this person proceeded to get in my face and without privacy or security and ordered us out of the WF branch, in front of XXXX and the whole world. Fortunately I walked away and since then I 've been attempting to have WF refund the {$82.00} they stole from us and now the Ass't VP, a employee of WF of XXXX years will not speak with us and refers us to the rude person who told us to leave their unsecured office. When I Googled ; Wells Fargo Complaints ; I could not believe what I was seeing. WF has XXXX of complaints for the very reasons we are requesting our {$82.00} to be refunded, which WF is dening. This is so WRONG in so many ways, and WF needs to make restoration to us and ALL the XXXX they are, have been and are continue to do illegally on a regular basis. Have you ever heard of the 21st Century Act, created by Busch, that supposively gives banks the right to extract funds from customers accounts without their knowledge and only finding out when WF notifies you that your account has insufficient funds and they'very charged your account with OD fees.

2268,"! I was scammed out of {$8900.00} of my hard earned money, for a car that does n't even exist, and yet my bank refuses to call it  fraud. '' They wo n't even file a fraud claim at this point. After several attempts to put in a claim for fraud, my bank still refuses to even consider the matter as nothing more than a consensual wire transfer, in which I knowingly gave all my money away to a crook.   To make this domestic wire transfer ( which, to my understanding, was told that it was an escrow account ), I needed to include XXXX pieces of information for the outgoing wire transfer request. It was not an escrow account at all. Rather a means by which a scammer took away all of my money. On the wire transfer services form, I have the date, the name of the banker, my name and address, the name of the beneficiary, their account number, their address, their routing number, the beneficiary 's bank name, and bank address. I was actually inside a branch, on the phone with this person, while I was making the wire transfer. The thief on the other end, however, was at least kind enough to take {$30.00} off of the original price of the car ( {$9000.00} ), and put it toward the cost of the wire transfer ( {$30.00} ), itself, making the amount to be received by the beneficiary exactly {$8900.00}.   So, on Tuesday, XXXX the XXXX, I made a domestic wire transfer from my bank ( Wells Fargo ) to a receiving bank ( XXXX ) in the amount {$8900.00} for a car that I was supposed to receive, from a seller with whom I made the transaction online. This car was a black 2013 XXXX XXXX XXXX featured on XXXX, under the XXXX section. I still have the link to the original posting ( http : XXXX ), which I will also be attaching with this email, as well as correspondence between myself and the seller. The original posting for this XXXX ad has since been flagged for removal, although I am not the one who flagged it. Needless to say, the car never arrived, of course, because it never existed in the first place. Within all of the documents I will be attaching are emails from the seller, in which they knowingly provide a false VIN number ( XXXX ), a fake XXXX report, request a dollar amount, and confirmation that they have received payment, as well as promise to ship the item between XXXX and XXXX on the XXXX of XXXX.   I have contacted my bank as well as the beneficiary 's bank regarding this matter. The beneficiary bank, XXXX, seems to be taking this matter very seriously and appears to be eager to help resolve this matter. They currently have placed a hold on the beneficiary 's account, and have their resolution team investigating. Wells Fargo, however, my bank, will not even file a recall, or a fraud claim. They outright refuse. Banks do not have to play judge or jury in matters of transaction disputes, and Wells Fargo takes it as their right to do just that : IGNORE IT! Even after all the proof I have given them, including the fake VIN number ( which the seller knowingly provided ), they refuse to say that it was a matter of fraud.

2297,"I contacted Chase to inform them that I disputed the charge for the XXXX in XXXX. Because my friend and I had been given only one key for our room the night before, I called the front desk to learn if I could remain a second day in the same room. The man at the desk put me on hold while he checked with the front desk manager, he told me. When he came back to the line, he said that my room  was taken care of. '' I assumed that meant that the hotel was offering it to me gratis for the problems of the previous night with the room key, so I planned to stay the second day. ( The key is needed to operate the elevator and electricity in the room as well as the door. ) There were additional problems when the telephone in the room later that day when the telephone stopped working. The room charge was $ XXXX/night.   In emails with the general manager of the hotel, I was given only {$100.00} credit for the key problem. ( He claimed that the telephone was working although several members of the hotel staff knew otherwise, and a friend who tried to call me were told the phone was told my phone was not working. ) I thought he should keep the promise and give me a night gratis. If I had not been offered the second night for free, I would not have remained at the hotel, as I called in the early afternoon and I could have checked out without incurring the additional charge.   I called Chase and told the story to the telephone rep requesting one night free. The Chase rep, however, suggested that I should ask for both nights free and promised to advocate on my behalf. She said she would be getting back to me for more information. I told her I had several emails with the general manager, which she asked me to save.   I was very disappointed to receive a letter from Chase a few days later denying my claim. No one contacted me as I was promised to ask for evidence or if I might accept a refund for the single night which I had tried to request. I would have to be satisfied with the {$100.00} I had been given.   I called and spoke to a supervisor but was told that there was nothing I could do. The decision was final, because of some law they sited. The reason is because a telephone, which was not really relevant to the hotel 's promise of the free room ( it was the missing door key the night before ), apparently the telephone is seen as a luxury. Lacking a room phone, therefore, and is not seen as a reason for a refund. I argued and argued, but nothing can be done. I have stayed at hotels all around the world. The rooms always have a telephone. When mine did not work, I did not stay in the hotel that night. After I finished my very late dinner, I stayed with a friend who lived nearby, saving the hotel some money for the early check out.   But my issue is with Chase. Perhaps if the rep had not suggested I asked for two nights free ( {$400.00} ), I would have been given the one night free, as I had been promised. I have discussed this issue now twice with a Chase supervisor to no avail.   I have searched for the letter from Chase denying the claim in my email but I believe it has expired and I no longer have access to the letter.

I was then required to give them my bank account information and link my bank 's information in order to pay it off instead of just being able to pay it using my debit card ( as I originally intended to and had done before through them ). While I was thankfully able to realize this before I was charged interest, I still believe this was a deceitful practice and caused me harm by requiring me to go through additional steps in order to pay off a charge which I never intended to put on their credit system.

We value long standing relationships, and it is the only thing that has prevented us from moving our account thus far but our frustration with these practices are pushing us to consider switching our accounts to a new financial institution.  It seems that since the new financial protections were put in place for consumers that restricts financial institutions from collecting or racking up arbitrary fees, that our bank has instituted a new way to collect these fees and revenue they have lost that are equally arbitrary and at a minimum are performed in a cloak and dagger fashion.  When we notice through online banking that our checking acct is running low on funds to cover checks or payments that we know we initiated but that do not yet appear to have been submitted to our account, we drive immediately to our local BB  T branch with cash in hand to deposit into our account. When we arrive, we always first inquire with the bank rep and verify that there are no  returned payments '' noted on our account. We then immediately deposit the cash that would then cover those payments. We then would notice repeatedly that when the bank performed their reconciliation processes after midnight of that same day that they would then first report a payment from a company was submitted and returned that same day and that they returned the payment to the submitter and charged a {$35.00} fee to our account and they would then go on to reflect on the next reconciliation line that they received the cash deposit made earlier that day  after the returned payment ''. I have spoken to bank reps repeatedly re this discrepancy between what we are told by their bank rep that no payments had been submitted and returned at the point of us making that cash deposit and then their coming back to us after their after midnight reconciliation process that indeed a payment had been submitted and returned that day and that they then state to me that it was submitted and returned  before '' we made the cash deposit and that the {$35.00} fee was deducted from our checking acct. This unfortunately has happened too many times for it to be a one off innocent error, and appears to instead be a new bait and switch technique for financial institutes to continue to recoup the arbitrary fees they had been supposedly prevented from recouping through the new consumer protections put in place. Very few times the bank rep was kind enough to deposit back the fee because many times it was the same rep I had originally spoken to when I was depositing the cash to cover the payments that I then spoke to later when I noticed this bait and switch technique and that the outcome did not comport with what she had advised me initially. But there are numerous fees that had not been credited back to our account under the same scenario, and this new bait and switch technique appears to be a new way of doing business for our bank.

2440,"On XXXX XXXX, I opened an XXXX of Credit with U.S.Bank. It had a draw period of 10 years and repayment of 15 years. I only needed a short-term loan. I made a payment on XXXX XXXX, XXXX. On XXXX XXXX, XXXX I made a final payment, paying off all principal and credit, closing the account ( PDF attached ). Review of the terms of the original contract and the payments that I made signify that I paid the loan balance and the {$350.00} prepayment penalty due when the account was closed within 3 years. ( page XXXX of contract PDF Attached ). The following year, in XXXX XXXX, I received a statement indicating that my balance was {$0.00} and showing a  Minimum Due '' of {$75.00}. I took this to the local branch of U.S.Bank to inquire. I was told that I could ignore the {$75.00} Due because I had a balance of {$0.00}. This charge would only apply if I wanted to reopen the line of credit. This information came from the branch manager. The following year, I again received a statement. It showed a balance due of {$150.00} and a balance of {$0.00}. I took this into the local branch and was told that I did not owe anything. All records showed that I had payed off this loan. In XXXX of XXXX, I received a letter stating that my account had been  charged off '' and sent to a credit bureau because I had been remiss in paying. I took this letter to the local branch. I was again told by a confused teller, I owed nothing. I asked to see a manager. The manager looked on-line and made calls and told me that indeed I owed this money due to a yearly fee, even though I had paid off all balances and debts in XXXX. At this time, I wrote letters to U.S.Bank and filed a complaint with CFPB ( Case number : XXXX ). Since that time, I have filed numerous documents with CFPB and written many letters toU.S.Bank. The  charge off '' was reversed and the negative credit report was erased. However, U.S.Bank continued to say that I owed the fees totaling {$900.00}. In XXXX, XXXX, I received an email from CFPB saying that my case had been closed. Though I had sent follow-up material to CFPB it seemed that all that had been done could be done. U.S.Bank said that if I did n't pay the {$900.00} by XXXX XXXX I would be assessed an additional {$75.00}. I called the contact I had from U.S.Bank, but she was on vacation. I called the credit line, verified the fees and attempted to pay. I was not able to pay and receive assurance that the account would finally be closed. I was directed to the local branch. I went in to pay at the branch, but was told I owed nothing. At my request a supervisor got involved and found the {$900.00} fee. I wrote a check and asked for written assurance that the account was closed. ( My intent was to stop the accumulation of charges while I argue that they were wrong in the first place. I wanted to regain this {$900.00}. ) They could not comply. They suggested that I keep checking on line for a couple of weeks to make sure it closed. In other words, I was back to XXXX. Once again, I had paid off my debts and could not be sure this account was closed. This reinforces my arguments of the last seven months that indeed, U.S.Bank had a faulty system that incurs debts against consumers without giving a service or product. At this point I called XXXX of your counselors at CFPB asking to reopen my case. I was told that my case was closed and could not be reopened. In addition, I was told that my original complaint had been about the Credit Bureau  charge off '' and that had been solved. I was advised to open a new complaint. That is what I am doing with this form. It is my goal to be paid back the {$900.00} fee and have U.S.Bank review and revise their policy and reporting.   ",john1300@purdue.edu,0

The damage to my credit is costing me a great deal of money. It is also preventing me from applying to a mortgage.  In XXXX a class action lawsuit was won and citizens agreed to pay customers that were previously harmed by the fees as well as to change their future overdraft practices.  Citizens Bank did not pay or rebate the fees in my case because my account was overdrawn. Think about this. Citizens charged me {$700.00} in fees through unfair overdraft practices- then refused to remedy my case because I was overdrawn!!!!!   Here is exactly what happened : XXXX weekend XXXX, I took my father to lunch on the Sunday. On Monday my account was negative over {$800.00}. How? Citizens put the XXXX lunch through as the XXXX transaction and then processed the smaller earlier transactions from Friday and Saturday. In total I was charged more than {$700.00} in fees.

I have been negatively affected by Citizens Bank 's poor consumer department, and the negative reports on my credit ( that has costs me huge in all aspects of credit ).  The policies that affected me were : Did not obtain affirmative consent from its customers prior to processing transactions that resulted in overdraft fees.  Manipulates and reorders transactions so that it can increase the number of overdraft fees it imposes.  Manipulates and reorders debits from highest to lowest in order to maximize the number of overdrafts and consequently, the amount of overdraft fees.  Delays posting of transactions by customers using debit cards so that customers are charged overdraft fees on transactions, even though the customers had sufficient funds in their accounts to cover the transactions upon execution.  Charges exorbitant overdraft fees that bear no relationship to the actual costs and risks of covering insufficient funds transactions.  Violates the consumer protection acts of certain states through its overdraft.   My rights as a consumer have been violated for 6 years. I demand this is removed from my credit report.

2642,"Over the past month I have written many complaints against Key Bank. I am writing this last complaint to simply sum up the issues that I have with this bank. I hope that the bank will be audited for excessive overdrafting again in the future. I had XXXX accounts with Key Bank, a personal checking account and a Hassle Free account. The Hassle Free account was attached to my personal checking account as an account that my teenaged son could use. He is a XXXX since he was just turning XXXX. The Hassle Free account issued a debit card with his name and I was able to transfer funds from my account to his account easily. Often, I would get very close to a XXXX balance as I live pay check to paycheck. Often I would deposit money through an ATM machine which would theoretically give me access to XXXX dollars immediately. However, through Key Bank 's magical accounting system, when the ledger would be managed by the bank, items would bounce because actually there was not immediate access to the money through the on line account.   I have several copies of my account and my son 's account as the bank was performing its processing during the evening and night hours. Often, the ledger shows a huge negative balance while the processing is happening. It 's hard to understand how a large modern bank like this has such antiquated accounting processes. I have an account in another bank and all transactions are immediate and neat. There is no messy, convoluted, unclear and dishonest practice that results in excessive overdrafts.   Anyway, the result of my complaining was that Key Bank closed my checking account. I did not ask for this. This created complete havoc in my financial life. I had to stop direct deposits and go to another bank to open an account for me and my son. When I talked to XXXX the representative of Key Bank who closed my account she did not even understand that the Hassle Free Account was my son 's and was connected to my personal account. She was going to leave the Hassle Free account open. So not only does key bank participate in magical accounting that results in excessive overdrafts for folks, but key bank also does not pay attention to its costumers and participates in retribution.   Lastly, for the years that I was involved with this bank, items would sit in the pending section of the account. Sometimes items would sit there for 10 days. But since Key Bank decided to close my account, items cleared within one day, even those items that were charged against the account by my son who is in another city. This shows that Key Bank purposefully leaves items in pending after which they reorder the debits to put the account in negative status.   I know that my complaining as I have could make me seem crazy and also that folks could argue that I do not manage my money well. But I represent many people who have no assets and who live pay check to pay check. This bank is notorious for these practices that I have highlighted over the last two months. I hope that at some point, Key Bank will be held accountable for their dishonesty and poor customer service. In the last year, I have paid the good part of XXXX $ in over draft fees. I do not have that money to give to Key Bank. XXXX the customer service rep said that she valued my patronage. Well, if that were true, then I would have had the overdraft fees refunded to me as I requested and Key Bank would not have tried to punish me by closing my account.   ",gong34@purdue.edu,1

In this rambling e-mail, the President/CEO of NBA, XXXX XXXX XXXX, basically said that his company was under attack by your organization, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau ( and specifically XXXX XXXX ). I did not follow up on his request to call ( XXXX ) XXXX to speak on NBA 's behalf - I have had an increasing concern over the past couple of years that I was being foolish and wasting my money through NBA, when I suspected I could easily just do for myself what they were doing for me and save both on the fees and the headaches associated with dealing with a XXXX party ( NBA is obviously external to the agreement between me and my mortgage holder, XXXX XXXX ).  Last week, on XXXX XXXX, XXXX, I received XXXX e-mails from NBA, all identical except for the subject line, which said  Account Suspension Notice - Open Immediately '',  Account Suspension Notice - Open Immediately - 2nd Notice '', or  Account Suspension Notice - Open Immediately - 3rd Notice '' ( i.e. there were XXXX sets of XXXX notifications, all on the same day ). In a nutshell, NBA said ...   ... we must inform you that we must suspend your account TEMPORARILY. This is not your fault, and we are working hard to resolve this situation as soon as possible. The most important things that you need to know are that : If we debited your account sufficiently in XXXX, NBA will make your next payment due XXXX XXXX, XXXX ; We will NOT be debiting your account in XXXX.   YOU will need to make your next FULL LOAN PAYMENT due XXXX XXXX, XXXX directly to your lender yourself ; and If there are any funds remaining in trust after NBA makes your XXXX XXXX, XXXX payment, they will be promptly returned to you.  There have been no follow-up e-mails. My numerous attempts to call have been met with the recording that says that due to unusually high call volume, call back later. They have not responded to e-mails.  It is now after XXXX XXXX EST on XXXX XXXX. They have not as yet paid my mortgage payment for XXXX XXXX, XXXX, as they promised they would in the  account suspension '' e-mails. I went back this past weekend and reviewed what NBA had taken out of my account over the past five years versus what they had actually paid to my mortgage holder, and there was over an {$11000.00} difference ( which will drop to about {$9700.00}, if they actually do end up paying my mortgage today ). I am not sure how much of that is what NBA considers  fees ''.   ",fische10@purdue.edu,1

XXXX of these transactions are from a market right across the street from my employer. I visit this place almost daily and I ALWAYS select  Debit '' and enter my PIN.

I have been told by multiple agents ( Wells Fargo customer service ) over the years that as long as I run the transaction as  Debit '' the funds will come out of my account immediately ( If ran as credit there is a valid delay in posting, depending on the merchant ). I have an inclination that the supervisor I spoke with may have been misleading about my transactions posting as  Credit '' in order to give a reason why the fees were valid, but I have no evidence or documentation to confirm this.

Each loan was given it 's own account number and each month I sent in XXXX checks as payment ... XXXX for each account. XXXX account number ended in XXXX and the other number ended in XXXX. In XXXX of XXXX, the bank erroneously credited both checks to XXXX account and I received notice that the other account was delinquent. I called the customer service number and resolved the issue, but in order to prevent future accounting errors, I decided to have the funds automatically debited from my checking account and applied to the appropriate loans. I received an email with what was supposed to be the proper paperwork, but it was only for XXXX. The next day I received another email with a form which I assumed was for XXXX, but it was also for XXXX. Once again, I called the customer service number and spoke with a woman. I gave her my name and XXXX account numbers. She informed me that both accounts had been consolidated and the new number ends in XXXX. I asked her what the amount was for the new consolidated loan, and she told me it was {$320000.00}! I was shocked, as this amount was twice as much as I had borrowed. She placed me on hold and when she returned, she said that they had another customer with my exact same name and exact same account number with the amount she had quoted me earlier. She told me that my loans had NOT been consolidated. She claimed to have resolved the issue and everything would be fine from here on out. Naturally, I was skeptical. So I sent an email to a customer service rep that I had been dealing with asking to send me XXXX ACH enrollment forms ; XXXX for each of my loans. From there on out, I began dealing with a man by the name of XXXX XXXX. He sent me an email with ACH enrollment forms which I completed and returned to him along with XXXX voided checks. He also asked me to send him XXXX separate emails, XXXX for each account with the following information : o Customer Name and Account Number ; o Customer 's Check Number ; o Amount of payment ; o Effective date of payment ; o Bank Name ; o XXXX Number ; o XXXX Number When I had completed all of that, I assumed I was finished. However, I received another email from XXXX XXXX about a month later stating that he had sent me the wrong form and that I needed to fill out another form. Once again, this form was for only XXXX loan and not XXXX. The email was addressed to XXXX XXXX ( My name is XXXX XXXX ), so I assumed that he had sent it to the wrong person. I replied to the email asking him if he had indeed sent it to the wrong person and asked for reassurance that the money was being automatically withdrawn from my account each month. He replied to the email stating that it had not. By now I had been dealing with this mess for over 4 months. I needed to speak with him personally and I could n't reach him by phone. I eventually became so busy that I forgot about the matter. A few months later, I was notified that my accounts had gone into default. They are now demanding full payment and are threatening me with legal action. I paid the smaller loan off completely and ca n't afford to pay the second XXXX off of about {$130000.00}. I asked to be put back on the original payment plan, and XXXX told me that I could. He sent me paperwork stating that over the course of 8 months, I would pay them about {$20000.00}. At the end of 8 months I would then pay off the entire amount of {$130000.00}. None of my {$20000.00} would be applied to principal. This is not what I was promised.

2778,"CLAIM AGAINST BB  T, WHICH THE CFPB REGULATES, FOR VIOLATION OF CONSUMER PROTECTION LAWS In XXXX 2014 ( my dispute with BB  T has gone on for months ), I called the Fraud Division of BB  T and reported criminal activity on my account. XXXX Sunday, I found myself locked out. I called the office of a company which purported to be in the locksmith business. I told the dispatcher that I needed to have my front door opened and a mailbox key made. He told me that the price for the work would be {$120.00}, which I agreed to pay. However, when the locksmith finished the job, he presented me an invoice for {$440.00} and threatened me physically if I did not sign the invoice. Under those frightening circumstances, I signed. I may have gotten a few facts wrong when I reported this incident in my initial letter to the bank, but I was so traumatized by these events that I had to process them with the help of a psychiatrist, and I shook each time I discussed them.   A few days after the incident, I filed a report with the XXXX XXXX XXXX Police Department. XXXX XXXX took the report. During our discussion, he mentioned that the Department had received complaints from XXXX other individuals regarding a swarthy looking man who had done some locksmith work on their property and had threatened them physically into signing an invoice several times greater than the amount that they had agreed to pay..  Four or five months into this debate, BB  T insisted that I provide the bank with a copy of the police report. I went to the Police Department and requested a copy, but they could not find it in their files. The Department 's failure to produce the report was not terribly surprising to me since I had filed a prior complaint with the Department on a totally different issue and they could not find that report in their files either.   I have exchanged several letter with BB  T 's Assistant General Counsel XXXX XXXX on this issue.

I have explained to her numerous times that I did not sign the invoice voluntarily but only because my life was threatened. I also told her that I refused to be penalized for the carelessness of the Police Department in maintaining its records.

It is my believe that Associated Bank had a responsibility to notify me in a prompt manner ( XXXX or XXXX XXXX ) in order for me to resolve this issue without fees. Associated Bank failed to do so which has led to the current issues. Once notified ( XXXX XXXX, XXXX ) I immediately contacted XXXX XXXX ( XXXX ext XXXX ) to resolve this issue. Associated Bank wishes to hold my home as ransom to force me to pay all fees. I have offered to pay all back payments and late charges ( {$600.00} ) and even attempted to online pay the amount of {$600.00}. In order to resolve this matter I am willing to split the attorney fees of {$890.00} with Associated Bank if they agree to restore my credit to its level of XXXX XXXX. Associated Bank via email yesterday has given me until XXXX XXXX, XXXX to pay ALL fees or they will continue foreclosure. I have also been informed that a supervisor ( XXXX ) would contact me. This has not happened 24 hours later.  If Associated Bank does not contact me to accept my offer I will pay the amount of {$1600.00} as required by XXXX XXXX, XXXX. I will then begin legal action against Associated Bank to have returned all fees and for {$3000.00} for the damage done to my credit due to Associated Banks actions. I have tried to be fair with this issue and have not even been given a chance to be heard.   ",zhu488@purdue.edu,1
2840,"On XXXX XXXX, I was XXXX on vacation. I have XXXX accounts with Bank of America : On XXXX XXXX of 2015 my personal checking acct. received my monthly XXXX deposit of {$870.00}. This acct. had {$10.00} in it bringing the balance to {$880.00}. My other XXXX accts. had less than {$5.00} each. I added via online BofA transfer services, {$40.00} to my second checking acct. and {$300.00} to my XXXX acct. Later that morning I went XXXX to use the ATM to remove XXXX from XXXX XXXX to pay my rental and have some running around money. XXXX is a sister like bank to BofA. I had trouble with the ATM working and tried it a couple time. Each time failed. A overly helpful XXXX man who spoke XXXX, kept reaching into my ATM area and pushing buttons to show me how to use an ATM. I pushed him off and suggest he leave. He eventually did leave. I finally used my XXXX card and managed to pull out XXXX. Exchange rate at that time was about XXXX to XXXX dollar. I went back to the rental and went online to let BofA know that I was in XXXX. so they would release my funds. I saw that my online acct. was being hacked and half of my funds were already gone. As I could not phone BofA from XXXX with my cell phone, I went online to a chat room and reported what was happening. The chat person at BofA, although trying to be helpful, did not seem to understand that my acct. was being hacked at that moment and by the time I got off the chat. All XXXX of my accts. contained less than XXXX dollar.  -- XXXX XXXX was the first time I could cross back into the XXXX, as I had to prepare for the worst and secure money for a trip back XXXX. The first thing I did was to go to BofA in XXXX XXXX and file a complaint with the bank. I showed my cards to the bank clerk and he handed XXXX card back that was not mine. I realized then that the person trying to help me at the ATM had stollen my card and replaced it with a card that looked like mine. This BofA clerk then made a call and turned me over to a representative. I explained what happened with the card and the acct. He said BofA was going to lend my acct. XXXX dollars. This BofA did not do, not a penny.  -- On or about the XXXX of the same month, I spoke to a representative online and they did not understand the theft, I then asked to be transferred to an  online banking fraud '' clerk. They transferred me and this person reviewed my acct. and immediately repaid my acct. XXXX. I then opened a savings acct. online. I called BofA and transferred that sum of money into the savings acct. with the help of a BofA clerk. All this was completed over the phone.  -- I started to receive notices from BofA that my claim with the debit card fraud was denied and they were going to take back the XXXX dollars from my acct. Recall please ; that they did not add any $ to any of my accts. On XXXX/XXXX/2015 BofA charged my checking acct. a negative amount of money ; XXXX. The next day my XXXX deposit of XXXX dollars hit the acct. and my balance left out of it was {$180.00}. Which is where it 's at today. I have not touched this acct. and wish for my XXXX money to be restored in full. They said they were taking out for the money given me for the debit card fraud and took the money for???  -- A side note : BofA 's online accts ( like my acct ) were hacked in XXXX and XXXX for more than a XXXX dollars. At least that is what I read online. The method they described matched the way they hit my acct.  -- I want my money back. I was insured. I want it back in my BofA acct.   Thank you for your time.

2841,"After my debit card and a book of checks were stolen, I called and had my card canceled and a freeze added to my checking account. A little while later I went to a branch of my bank and they began the process of switching me to a new checking account number. Because of the conversation and a few other past issues with the bank, I decided to close my checking account and find a new bank.  I visited the Wells Fargo website for information about closing accounts and was told it needed to have a zero balance in order to process. I transferred the remaining funds in the checking account to my Wells Fargo savings account and went to a different branch, XXXX closer to my office.  There, a very nice banker told me he could close my savings account ( the XXXX with the transferred checking funds ) but had to wait a day to close the checking account because of pending transactions. He showed me where my checkings account had a zero balance, with the XXXX pending transactions included. We closed savings and I called the next morning to the Wells Fargo customer service line to close checking ( because the website says that 's possible ).  Instead, I was told those XXXX pending items had n't cleared - even though all XXXX were conducted by noon the previous day and the bank 's policy is to post transactions made by XXXX on a business day by XXXX. XXXX of the transactions were with the bank, including removing a small amount of cash and moving some checking funds to my linked XXXX credit card.  I was told the process could be finished by XXXX meaning I could call after lunch and close the final account.  But I checked the account after lunch to confirm the pending items were posted so I could close the account and an overdraft charge was added to the checking account for transferring all the funds out to my savings.  I spoke with a customer service representative who said he could do nothing because the overdraft charge was justified, even though my account was zeroed out in order to close it the day before and nothing else posted.  I went to the branch that helped me the day before and the banker that helped me was the XXXX to assist me again. He called his supervisor over and told him my account was rightfully at {$0.00} the day before. The supervisor looked at my account and agreed it was n't right. He tried to remove the overdraft charge, but the systems were n't working and told me I would have to go to another branch the next day to make sure it was removed and my balance was back at {$0.00}.  Those XXXX pending transactions were all made well before the cutoff the day before, but the customer service representative said she ca n't close a XXXXbalance account with the pending accounts ( including the XXXX done with the bank ). But the transfer of checking funds to my savings account, which was done at XXXX., was posted - not pending, and I find that suspect.  Now I 'm having to go to the bank again - on a weekend - to see if they processed the overdraft refund and if my pending transactions are finally posted, a full day after they were supposed to be.  I have not done anything with my account as far as spending or transferring funds other than those transactions, yet by not posting them in a timely manner, I 'm being held hostage with this account and incurring fees that are not justified.  The bank has not followed it 's own policy for posting transactions to customer accounts, they are levying bogus charges and then their own staff members are admitting it 's not correct. I have been hung up on by a customer service supervisor today, I have more waiting and travel tomorrow to ensure they 've fixed another of their mistakes, and I am being told every time I contact them it 's either  not their problem '' or their systems are down again and I can not close my account with a {$0.00}.

2847,"On XXXX XXXX, 2015 I used my Wells Fargo ATM card to withdraw {$200.00}. Instead of issuing me the money, the ATM shut down, but did deduct {$200.00} from my checking account. That day, I filed a complaint via WF customer service ( telephone ). I was told my complaint would be settled in 3 days. After 3 days I called and was told it would take 10 days. After 10 days I spoke to WF 's ATM Manager and she said the investigation could take 45 days -- or longer. She basically accused me of trying to defraud Wells Fargo and when I asked if she considered me a criminal, she was silent. She was so abusive that I expected the police to ring my doorbell any day and arrest me! The Wells Fargo ATM Manager is an exceedingly rude, belligerent bully. Because of her -- after being a customer for 35 years! -- I decided to close my Checking Account and went to my local branch at XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX where I spoke to Service Manager XXXX XXXX.   This was on XXXX XXXX, 2015. XXXX XXXX told me that because WF has issued me a  temporary credit '' of {$200.00} while it investigated my ATM claim, I could not close my account. On XXXX XXXX I wrote WF CEO XXXX XXXX a letter explaining what happened and telling him that WF was holding my checking account hostage ( not allowing me to close it ) and I offered to let him keep the disputed {$200.00} -- just let me close my account!!! He did not respond. Around XXXX XXXX, I received a letter from WF saying the company was still researching my complaint. On XXXX XXXX, I sent another letter to XXXX telling him again that I want to close my account, and I included a check for the disputed {$200.00} hoping that would induce him to allow me to close my account. Did n't happen.   Around XXXX XXXX, I received a letter saying that the claim was finalized on XXXX XXXX in my favor. With that notice Wells Fargo was, in my opinion, admitting that I am not the criminal that the ATM manager called me. I did not try to defraud the company, something I knew all along.   At the end of XXXX, I received a call and letter from XXXX XXXX, ATM/Debit Card Executive Office. We spoke around XXXX XXXX. I told her I want to close my checking account and asked if I could do it over the phone. She said yes and put me in touch with someone who took all of my information and said I would receive a check for the remaining balance in the account ( {$1500.00} ) within five days. I just looked at my account online a few minutes ago and it appears not to have been closed and the {$1500.00} remains in my account -- unreachable by me. If I try to write a check against the {$1500.00}, WF may claim that I knowingly wrote a check against a closed account, even though the account appears to be open.

This finally happened last year when I was told that occasionally charges would still go through ( due to  systemic '' issues ), and if that were to happen, I should come into the branch to get any overdraft charges reversed. This happened once on XXXX, three times on XXXX, and twice on XXXX. I went into the bank to get these overdraft charges reversed and was told something new, that overdraft protection only applies to charges that are made from my debit/credit card and not to charges routed through the bank account like checks. Since the charges were made from my XXXX card, which routes through my bank account, my account was overdrawn. Additionally, after Wells Fargo initially approved the charges ( against what I had been told would happen ), they then cancelled the payment the following day. When I asked why the bank first approved the payment and then cancelled it, I was told by a rep that Wells Fargo  tries to be helpful '' by  giving me until the end of the day to cover the cost of the charge.

2996,"XX/XX/2015 I had received a settlement, and I deposited it into my XXXX accounts at Chase Bank. It was a pretty large settlement, so I knew I had enough money in my accounts to cover bills and day to day living expenses. I am not very tech savvy so I do not do a whole lot of internet transactions. Middle of 2015 I got sick and was in the hospital, and after my recovery, I took my XXXX kids on a small vacation. After getting back from my vacation, I started to get mail from Chase informing me of my accounts being over drawn. None of this made sense as I knew I had a good bit of money in both of my accounts. I went to the closest Chase bank to me and spoke with a personal banker, who printed out detailed statements for both accounts for me. The banker informed me to go home and look over all the charges and call the XXXX number for the charges that I did not recognize. They also advised me that filing a police report would be helpful. I left the bank with over XXXX pages of transactions. It was so overwhelming that I was in shock, and denial of what had happened to me. The next morning I filed a report with the local police department. They told me that they would look into this, and be in touch. Until this day I have heard nothing back from them, and the report was filed on XXXX XXXX 2015. XXXX % of the pages and pages of charges did not belong to me, and had all been done via the internet. I called the fraud department at Chase Bank to file a dispute for all the fraudulent charges. The lady I spoke to said she would closed out my debit card and issue me a new one for XXXX accounts. I began listing the unauthorized charges to her, and after about 25 minutes of being on the phone with her, she said I didnt have to tell her anymore, and that since it was to the same few online merchants, she would take care of it. She informed me about getting credit back to my account with 72 hours while they investigate the disputes. WRONG! I received a letter from Chase a couple of weeks later informing me that they were taking the credits back as the representative filed it the wrong way, and that the time to dispute the items now had passed. The representative was supposed to file it as an identity theft dispute, due to the way the activity was on my accounts. I was in total shock. I went from having thousands of dollars in my accounts, to now owing the bank thousands in over draft fees. I made an appointment with the Chase bank branch manager and went in hoping to resolve this error that was done on their part. Unfortunately, all she could do was call the fraud department and hand me the phone, just for them to tell me that it was too late to do anything. Since then Chase closed both of my accounts, as they were over drawn. I am receiving collection notices from them daily. I had been a victim of identity theft. After doing a little digging myself, I found out that someone had hacked my accounts, and changed my email address, so I was not getting any notifications of any activity on any of my accounts. The major charges were to apple itunes, XXXX, xbox and amazon. Since my email had been changed, I was not receiving any receipts that are automatically sent to you when you make a purchase with any of these merchants. I even had proof that my regular credit cards had the same charges, with the same amounts, on or around the same dates, which I brought with me to Chase to show them, and they told me the same thing.

I had a direct deposit in the account so I was n't able to access any of my money. It makes it worst when they do n't have any branches within XXXX miles of XXXX XXXX. The next issue was the debit card. I requested to have a debit card sent, but they ended up sending me a debit card for the closed account. So I had to wait another 14 days just to receive that.

This was probably the only thing they did right, however, they ended up charging me for a full box of checks that I never ordered and never received.

3058,"I wanted to bring to the CFPB the following instance where I think consumer protection needs to be applied. I bank with Bank of America. I utilize on-line banking for Bill Pay and for managing my finances. I have direct deposit and other features which I use on a regular basis. On the interface user platform website that consumers see when they log in to On-Line Bank is the listing of accounts. When you go into each account, you see a snapshot of your account, with summary, account balance, available history and then below that what is processing for that day and what has cleared. When you go to Bill-Pay Screen where customers can make automatic payments, there is outgoing payments box.   About two weeks ago, I instructed Bank of America to make payments to my children school, each totaling {$3100.00}. I, technically speaking, asked the bank to process and issue a check for me to be paid on XX/XX/XXXX. I also a few weeks ago also asked the bank to process a payment for XXXX XXXX for {$100.00}. Today, I checked my on-line banking account page and saw that my XXXX XXXX payment was  processing '' and my account was deducted by the {$100.00}. But the payments made by Bank of America to my children 's school for {$3100.00} each were not showing up as  processing. '' This is a considerable amount of funds that were essentially processed by the bank with a confirmation assigned by the bank for the transition. Yet, my on-line banking balance did not reflect anywhere this deducted amount as of XX/XX/XXXX.   When I inquired, the Bank of America customer service said that that they do n't on the bill pay side show on the summary account side processed checks that they were instructed to send as  processing '' nor to they show this deduction anywhere in the on-line bank balance account summary or processing transactions. The only way you would know that these pending transactions were to be posted on XX/XX/XXXX were to go into Bill Pay. Then manually figure out your balance to know that you were not going to overdrawn when ACH clears at XXXX.   I bring this to your attention because I believe that any bank online user interface should be consumer friendly. No where would I know on my account summary that XXXX checks each for {$3100.00} were going to be debited from my account on XX/XX/XXXX unless I remembered to check my bill pay page. The summary of my account page does not reflect these as  processing '' payment even though I instructed the bank to send out or process these payments. If I did not have adequate funds or overdraft protection, I might run the risk of over drawing my account without realizing it because my account summary as of XX/XX/XXXX did not show these XXXX pending debits. The bank would then be able to charge me {$35.00} overdrafts and return checks. A consumer would have no way of knowing accurately what there bank account balance is as of the date payments are being sent and processed by the Bnak Please advise and to who I might talk to about this very frustrating and worrisome feature. Bank 's make most of their money off these types of consumer fees but, in fact, so consumers are accurately informed any consumer interface should be clear, accurate and reflect any and all transactions that the bank has been asked to process on behalf of the consumer / customer. I have screen shots I have shared with CFPB about what happened today on XX/XX/XXXX regarding account summary, processing transactions and bill pay.   ",gong34@purdue.edu,1

I called customer service and was bounced from customer service to claims and back to customer service.  After speaking to the customer service representative who told me there was nothing they could do, I asked to speak to a manager. The manager told me that someone had already tried to refund the fees using the automated system and that they were declined. I explained that the first person I spoke to probably did that before they transferred me to claims. The manager said I would need to have the company who charged me write a letter stating they did not have permission to charge my account to be able to refund the fees.  I asked if I should have filed a claim, which is what I thought I did, and the manager said that yes I could have filed a claim if I had let the item post. I mentioned that if I had waited the 2-3 days for it to post I would have had a negative account balance the whole time and would not have been able to use my debit card. The manager told me that this is what I was supposed to have done.  I pointed out that I got charged a stop payment fee and a returned item fee and I wanted to know why I got charged both, if the stop payment went through then why was there a return fee. The manager told me that I had a stop payment placed on the company name, but they charged me with a slightly different name and that is why I was charged both fees. I told him that was a technicality and he said he was sorry but that he was n't going to do anything about it and  if it was the first time you were complaining about fees, maybe I could do something.

How is it that my online account knows I have XXXX pending but my actual account does not? They intentionally ignore the deposit that is going into the account, hit me with XXXX overdraft charges, then suddenly credit the deposit and withdrawal the service charges.

3070,"I got a notice about some unusual activity on an account that I set up for my younger brother to pay his expenses while in college, basically transferring all the money electronically to a different account through a program called XXXX. After confirming that it was n't initiated by my brother ( it was not ), I called and immediately asked for a hold to be placed. For this, I was charged {$30.00} which pushed the account into overdraft, but I was not worried, because I was assured the money would be returned in short order. Fast forward to 4 days, the transaction clears, to my incredulity, for which I was charged an additional overdraft fee. Furthermore, a number of transactions for very minimal accounts were in processing PRIOR to this transaction being posted and I was charged an overdraft fee for all of them. Finally, the bank decides to decline a transaction from paypal for {$9.00} and {$5.00}, respectively. I was charged a {$35.00} NSF fee for each transaction. As if this were not insulting enough, XXXX and the bank then proceeded to recharge, and return those transactions a stunning XXXX times, charging a {$35.00} fee on each occurrence.

3071,"On XXXX/XXXX/16 I received an email alert letting me know that my checking account was overdrawn. The email was puzzling since I know that I had not purchased any big ticket items. I immediately went to the bank branch where I opened my account to see what happened. This is what was explained to me : My checking account had been charged a series of 'mini fees ' that had been collected through debit card transactions. I asked why would the bank allow the transactions to continue when there was no money in the account? There was a mediocre explanation that eventually led to a requested print-out, by me, of my account. The print out revealed that SunTrust had been charging fees to my account of XXXX for each and every transaction. On some days, my account was charged up to XXXX of these XXXX fees on the same day. I 've been with SunTrust for less than six months, and they continue to, or the employee who opened the account, continues to make glaring errors in relation to my account. How? First, the account was set up improperly. Second, the representative who opened the account did not explain all of my options to me. This experience leads me to believe that there is poor management at this branch location ( XXXX XXXX ) and that the manager, XXXX XXXX is doing a horrible job with both managing and properly training his employees.  On XXXX/XXXX/16 I left a message at the branch requesting that XXXX XXXX call me. On XXXX/XXXX/16 when I saw XXXX XXXX to check on my account status, he had not even looked into it and explained to me that he had been busy. On XXXX/XXXX/16, XXXX XXXX explained to me that again he had been busy. It was not until that day that he even begin addressing my account. To this day, he has not taken responsibility in the mismanagement of my account and instead is trying to cover up for his employee, XXXX XXXX, who opened my accounts. I believe that XXXX XXXX and XXXX XXXX are more interested in meeting their account quotas instead of the care and attention to the consumer.  When I first opened account XXXX XXXX made a serious error of placing all of my money into my savings account instead of my checking account, as I had requested. This resulted in gross errors that led had to be straightened out when I went to pay my bills ; Certain payments did not go through due to XXXX XXXX 's error. In that instance, I do not believe XXXX XXXX was counseled by his manager. Something is amiss in the training if XXXX XXXX is allowed to continue making these mistakes and his manager is content with making excuses for his employees instead of re-training his employees and making sure the consumer is okay. XXXX XXXX sent me an email claiming that he tried to call me on the XXXX, but I do not believe that to be true, as I received no phone call. I, once again, had to be the one following up with him concerning my account.  A total of approximately XXXX in fees were charged to my checking account ; fees that are both exorbitant and ludicrous seeing the nature of the fees. SunTrust was allowing card transactions to go through whether or not there was any money in the account. I feel that this was an instant payday predatory practice by the bank as they are aware that my paychecks are direct deposited every two weeks like clockwork. I believe that I was seen as an easy target and money could be made from my account due to my direct deposit. I will reiterate that these options were not explained to me thoroughly when I opened my account. My account was set up improperly. It is for this reason that I am requesting a full refund of all of my fees. SunTrust has violated my trust and is exploiting the consumer.  My account was being charged for debit card transactions of XXXX, XXXX, XXXX, XXXX, XXXX, XXXX, XXXX, XXXX, XXXX, XXXX, etc. SunTrust is taking advantage of consumers.   ",afrances@purdue.edu,0

The CD was most recently renewed for a 24-Month term on or about XXXX XXXX XXXX.  2 ) I received an account Maturity Notice from PNC on or about XXXX XXXX XXXX. This Notice stated that the CD would mature on XXXX/XXXX/XXXX with a value of {$4200.00}. It also stated that, unless otherwise directed, the CD would be automatically renewed for an identical term, at a rate to be determined on the Maturity Date.   3 ) The above-referenced Notice and the original agreement provided, inter alia, for a grace period of ten ( 10 ) days beyond the Maturity Date for making penalty-free changes to and withdrawals from the CD.   4 ) On or about XXXX XXXX XXXX I mailed a Direct Rollover Transfer Request to XXXX XXXX XXXX bank ( XXXX ), asking that the entire proceeds of the CD at PNC be transferred on the Maturity date to my IRA account at XXXX. This was done in a form provided by XXXX, and included full particulars of the IRA and the XXXX at PNC.   5 ) After telephoning me in the following week to verify all particulars of my request, XXXX sent me an email on XXXX XXXX XXXX, confirming that they had sent the Transfer Request to PNC Bank for processing. PLEASE NOTE that this was a full twelve ( 12 ) days before the end of the grace period for penalty-free withdrawals from the PNC account.   6 ) After a delay of several weeks, XXXX confirmed that an amount of {$4200.00} had finally been received on XXXX XXXX XXXX from PNC. On or about XXXX XXXX XXXX I also received a notice from PNC ( mailed on XXXX XXXX XXXX from ZIP Code XXXX ) confirming the closing of the account and the transaction amount, but without any other accounting.   7 ) This unexplained discrepancy between the maturity amount and what was ultimately transferred leads me to conclude that PNC Bank had willfully and intentionally delayed transferring the funds till after the grace period had expired. Then, invoking the early-withdrawal penalty provision, they had confiscated {$24.00}, which exceeded even the {$21.00} the CD had earned over the preceding 24 months.   ",dcherian@purdue.edu,0

On XXXX XXXX, 2016, XXXX check s in the amounts {$4900.00} and {$4900.00} were deposited into our account at an ATM located in XXXX, XXXX ; which neither of us resides in. I live in XXXX, XXXX and my daughter attends college in XXXX, XXXX. The checks that were deposited were XXXX checks drawn from a BOA account. The following day XXXX men came to my daughter 's apartment, presented their XXXX business cards and told her that XXXX accidently wired almost $ XXXX into her account and that they were there to collect the money. She was unaware of the deposit at the time but checked her account and confirmed what the men said was true. She is a XXXX XXXX XXXX college student who was taught not to question authority so she did what they told her to do. Because she is so naive of banking, she thought bank withdrawals had daily limits like ATM withdrawal so she withdrew half the money at one bank and the other half from another branch and gave it to them. Two days later, XXXX returned the checks back to BOA ; which resulted in our account being overdrawn for {$9700.00} and they deactivated my ATM card for all my accounts ; which is how I was notified of the fraud. I immediately submitted a fraud claim with the bank to conduct an investigation. About a week later an investigator called my daughter who conferenced me on the call. BOA pulled the camera footage for the ATM where the checks were deposited and were able to confirm that the deposits were s made by a man, the investigator told us that the man had been implicated in other investigation conducted by Bank of America however they only had his image but did not know who he was. The investigator was trying to intimidate my daughter by insinuating that she was part of the fraud ; by questioning why she made XXXX withdrawals as well as how the men would know where she lived. After the call with the investigator I went on line and did a people search under my daughter 's name ; which showed that she resides in XXXX, XXXX and for {$7.00} I could have purchased a full report ; which included her full address. It was a completely unbiased investigation ; any criminal can infiltrate our personal information from the internet ; which is why identity theft is such a security threat to us all. Although BOA did confirm that the checks deposited were not done by me or my daughter nor was it my daughter signature on the check ; they denied the claim and are now holding us responsible for repayment of all the money, they submitted us to XXXX and have closed the account. They have refused to take any responsibility for their lack of due diligence.  Initially we did not see the purpose of filing a police report as we felt nothing would come from it and no matter what the results of the police investigation, Bank of America would still holding us responsible for the repayment of the money. However after speaking to a Consumer Protection attorney, he advised me to submit a police report to have it on record that a fraud was committed against us.  BOA should be held responsible for not doing their due diligence to protect us by neglected to identify the below red flags : 1. The deposits were made at an ATM outside of the states the either of us live in 2. The unusualness of a deposits so large in student accounts when the average balance is only {$400.00} 3. Their failure to confirm account holder signature 4.

3243,"Beware of Corporate Citizen 's Bank related to Retaliation for Posting Information and Reviews about a Security Breach in Online/Telephone Banking and for filing with the Attorney General : Five days ago I received a letter in the mail stating that all my bank accounts ( mine, my husband, XXXX our businesses, savings, and all XXXX children 's accounts ) would be summarily closed in 10 days, no reason given. I have been a customer at Citizen 's Bank for 15 plus years with impeccable credit and have never even bounced a check or had a late payment. Apparently it is Citizen 's prerogative and they can close your accounts with NO notice and for No reason! Apparently when I signed up 15 plus years ago, there was a box to check that allows them to do this, go figure?  Nonetheless I do KNOW the reason why Corporate Citizen 's closed all my accounts!!! I have repeatedly written on social media, written to the AG about a MAJOR Security Issue at Citizen 's Bank and I believe shutting all my accounts is in RETALIATION for alerting other customers to the security flaw. The back story is : in XXXX XX/XX/2014 XXXX of my linked bank accounts were compromised. Someone called Citizen 's on an inside line ( pretext calling ) and said they were sitting with my husband in the local branch and that he needed help setting up online banking. Neither of us bank online. All the caller needed was the last XXXX of my social, then they set up a phoney email address and password, and voila they were into ALL my family and business linked accounts. Funniest thing that call was NEVER recorded, very odd since generally every time I call the bank I hear  you are on a recorded line ''. Once they got in, {$30000.00} was transferred/borrowed from a Home Equity Credit Line ( who has {$30000.00} sitting around anyway ) into linked accounts and then they went to ATM 's in XXXX and XXXX and in 6 hours withdrew {$30000.00} in increments of {$600.00} and NO ALGORITHM at Citizen 's picked this up??? I, the lowly customer, happened to notice the activity when I checked my balances that day! I do n't know about you but I have NEVER been able to withdraw more than {$400.00} in a given day without getting shut down. Needless to say, this is a major security breach. Citizen 's was clearly at fault and after two weeks returned the {$30000.00} to my credit line and only after I filed numerous police reports. However, the bank has consistently passed the buck by both not returning repeated phone calls and by not repairing the online/telephone banking issue. Also since the breach, my social security number along with my entire family, DOB, address have all been compromised. I have had to file Fraud Alerts and have had to put a Freeze on all of our Credit Reports for 7 years. At no time did Corporate Citizen 's Bank, XXXX XXXX in particular in the Office of the Chairman, ever take my calls, offer to help, give advice or even TAKE RESPONSIBILITY for the Security Breach and/or consider paying for Life Lock or some such plan ( {$10.00} per month ).

I feel this is almost fraudulant, as this was unauthorized for Chase to do without my knowledge or my permission. And I have not even received a call from them, or any notices as of today. I am not sure who I can possibly report this to or how I can get this resolved other than having to stop banking with this fraudulant bank. I have banked with them for so many years, and yet they have no attempt of resolving any issues with me, whether it be over the phone or even at the branch. Nothing but bunch of arrogant supervisors which consumers like myself, have to deal with which is not very attractive, and very difficult to approach when dealing with this type of subject in the matter of our own money and funds.

Rather than the bank notify me or simply reject the deposit they have closed my accounts without releasing the funds and reported me to XXXX for suspected fraud. Since this occurred My other bank closed out my checking account and the new bank I tried denied me.

3405,"I made some purchases using XXXX and still had some old account information listed for an account that I thought I had closed after my divorce since it still has my ex-husband 's name on it. There were many purchases made over a short period of time and as soon as I was notified of the problem, I updated my payment information on XXXX to remedy the problem. I did not realize that my USAA savings account ( which has had zero activity in over 18 months aside from a total of XXXX cents paid in interest which has kept the account from going dormant ) was even still open so did not worry until I received a notice from the bank that my account was overdrawn approximately {$340.00}. I immediately called the bank to fix the problem and they nicely removed {$110.00}, or XXXX, of the NSF fees I had been charged and the representative told me that was all she could remove in XXXX day and to call back tomorrow to see if I could continue to have more fees removed from my account. When I called the next day I was told that this was inaccurate information and that they can only remove XXXX fees per 12 month period. I asked to speak with a manager, who basically told me the same thing and when I asked to speak with her manager, I was hung-up on. So I called back and tried to explain how this account was supposed to be closed and that I 'm happy to pay for the items I purchased that they paid for including the overdraft charges for those XXXX items. The next  manager '' said he could find no documentation that I had requested to have the account closed but he also could not find any of the information about the other XXXX checking accounts that I had closed and that I had for years and essentially said I was lying. I tried a few more times to get some information and talk to some other people and was asked to get a letter from XXXX outlining the items that were being submitted and returned and that if I presented this letter I would have better luck in getting XXXX more NSF returned ( there were a total of XXXX NSF fees that I do n't think I should have to pay and XXXX overdraft fees that I am more than willing to pay ). I offered each time to give my account information to pay for the outstanding items the bank covered, along with their corresponding overdraft charges and every time I was denied, given different information ( basically a runaround ), and insulted to the point that I will be moving my auto/renters insurance to another company, which they do n't seem to care about either. The icing on the cake happened today with yet another manager called at my request so I could follow up about the requested XXXX letter. She decided to bring up the issue of the bankruptcy that was filed almost 2 years ago that resulted after my husband 's failed business and also ended us in divorce. She said they will absolutely not forgive anything because I left them with {$40000.00} of debt and because it 's not their fault that I 'm  negligent with my finances '' and that I 'm supposed to monitor my accounts. Had I known this account was still open, I would have indeed closed it. I am willing to fight this company any way I can because of the way they have treated me. I have worked very hard to rebuild my credit and am appalled they had the nerve to bring up my bankruptcy case when this is a right we have in this country and not something I ever WANTED to have happen. My credit score is almost XXXX and I have NEVER had an overdraft or NSF at my current banking institution. If this ends up in collections, I will also be fighting it there to maintain the credit score I have worked so diligently to rebuild. The conclusion from the manager today was that she felt USAA was being  more than generous. ''   ",wu467@purdue.edu,0

As a courtesy Chase called me to verify the charges, which I of course said they were unauthorized, then Chase agreed to give me a refund in the meantime while they handled the dispute with the merchants and would send me a new debit card to ensure no further unauthorized charges. All while this is going on, I supposed the  back office '' of Chase reviewed my account and decided that they no longer would be doing business with me, and chose to close the account. I never received notice of this decision. When I received my new card in the mail, it did n't work and I called in to customer service and was informed of my account being closed. I was never given the reason why, but I told the representative that this would n't work because I had direct deposit coming from my employer that was too late to change. Either way, the closure was n't scheduled for another XXXX business days ( the XXXX business day was today ) so my direct deposit went through just fine.

I am retired and receive a monthly Social Security check and a pension check from my former employer. My wife continues to work and will receive her XXXX Social Security check next month. In checking my bank statement today, I discovered that I had been charged five overdraft fees of {$35.00} each.  My account never had a negative balance. My wife and I went to the bank on this past Saturday to deposit a payroll check from her company. I specifically told the Teller in front of my wife that I was depositing a pay check and asked her to deposit the amount of the check as cash as the bank had agreed to do many times before. The Teller advised me and my wife that the check was deposited as cash. Today, I discovered that the bank had deposited {$500.00} as cash and the remainder of the check as a check subject to the banks holding policy on checks deposited into checking accounts. I called the Customer service XXXX number and explained the problem. The service representative understood my complaint and put me on hold to talk to her Supervisor. When she returned to the call, she advised that she was transferring me to her Manager to resolve the problem. Her Supervisor immediately got the Branch Manager of the XXXX Bank on the line and left the call. I explained the problem to the Branch Manager and she asked me if I had identified the check as a payroll check. I told her that I had done this as I have done many times previously. She said that the Teller was working today and put me on hold to ask her if I had identified the check in question as a payroll check. She got back on the line and said that the Teller did n't recall but later called me back and said that the Teller did remember cashing my check as cash, giving me {$500.00} at the time and depositing the remaining {$1600.00} as cash into our checking account. However, our account did n't reflect this understanding causing the {$170.00} overdraft fee. The Branch Manager said she would look into this but called me back to advise that she could n't reverse the {$170.00} overdraft fees because there has been a change in policy resulting in our account being charged the fees. I told her that we were not advised of any change in policy and the Teller had told us that the check was being deposited as cash into our checking account.

I uploaded the text of that offer to the PayPal claim folder and discussed it over the phone with a PayPal customer service rep who approved of it and welcomed my cooperation.

Every time I have called to complain about how my available balance changes from day to day, the supervisors and customer representatives tell me that the automatic system rearrange transactions in different ways. Sometimes the automatic system will process larger transactions first and others the system will not process transactions correctly over the weekend. Consequently, on Monday morning the average costumer will be surprised with a bunch of overdraft fees. I have asked supervisors and customer reps to amend the mistakes that the automatic service makes. Some managers will waive a few charges. Others, like the last supervisor I spoke with will tell me that if I balance my account using my phone or a computer, I am destined to pay overdraft fees every week. If that is the truth, why does bank of America promotes mobile applications, online banking usage and online statements? Then, to make it more ridiculous the supervisor told me that if I kept doing my balance using paper and pencil and comparing it with my online balance, I was also destined to be charged hundreds of dollars in overdraft fees.

Over the 10 years he has never bounced a check. XX/XX/2015 he made a mistake and the account became over-drafted ( he did n't realize ) a few days later he received an automated deposit in which made the account positive again. He then paid his rent and other bills with out knowing he had been charged several over draft fees. This resulted in the account again becoming over drafted. Apparently he was allowed to continue to use his ATM debit account due to the fact the account has over-draft protection. The account went several days into over draft before he realized the entire situation. Once I called the bank  spoke with the branch manager they had charged the account {$40.00} per day with a total of {$750.00}. The manager after checking with her regional supervisor agreed to refund {$100.00}. My complaint is as follows : myself nor my son where given written or verbal notice of the over draft of the account or fees being charged.  1 ) The fees are excessive in nature!  2 ) The overdraft protection should n't allow the consumer continue to engage in charges to the account when over-drafted after a certain amount of usage.  3 ) The bank has misused overdraft protection allowing the bank to charge the consumer absorbent fees without notice.  4 ) The fees charged to the account and action taken by the bank is egregious towards consumers.   ,hughe146@purdue.edu,0

For instance - a customer has {$100.00} in their account. XXXX items are presented for payment. XXXX items for {$90.00}, XXXX items for {$15.00} and XXXX item for {$20.00}.

On XXXX XXXX, 2015, I electronically signed into USAA to cash out the CD and pay the balance of the secured loan.

3742,"XXXX : WHAT HAPPENEDI am complaining about a deceptive, negative-option add-on product called  XXXX XXXX Solutions '' on PNC Merchant Services small business accounts. This is similar to the negative option affilliate marketing products that have been the bain of consumer accounts for years. The CFPB in its bank oversight role needs to nip this in the bud on the Small business accounts.   In XX/XX/XXXX I cancelled credit card processing on my PNC merchant bank account through PNC Merchant services. In XX/XX/XXXX I deactivated my credit card processing with them, and I stopped getting billed a monthly fee. In XX/XX/XXXX, they started charging a monthly fee for XXXX. They said that they imposed this charge via a letter that they sent me in XX/XX/XXXX advising me of the new fee, and they said they had the right to charge new fees according to the merchant agreement. This merchant agreement, they say has a pro-rate early termination charge. My early termination charge at this time they say would be {$450.00}. I dispute signing a three year agreement with an early termination charge. Also I argue a contract that they have the right to arbitrarily add charges is a contract of adhesion - and at best there is a duty of good faith and fair dealing in adding charges. In this case, a new {$24.00} charge for an inactive account for protection not needed or asked for is not good faith - especially when the letter they sent me was sent to an outdated address, a letter that did not get to me. On the other hand their statements do get to me electronically. They could have sent me the letter electronically as well.  Finally, PNC Merchant Services is a deceptive name. They claim they are separate from PNC bank. They were referred to me by PNC Bank, and they use PNC 's logo. I updated my address with PNC Bank in XX/XX/XXXX, I presumed ( wrongly, I guess ) that PNC Merchant Services would receive the updated address as well.   ",zeng60@purdue.edu,0

3793,"On XXXX XXXX of 2015, I called the Customer Service Phone Number for Citizens Bank in Rhode Island because I noticed a {$35.00} overdraft fee that did not seem appropriate. Specifically, the fee was assessed on XXXX/XXXX/15 for check # XXXX in the amount of {$220.00}. I feel the fee is unfair because the check was only processed by the bank on XXXX/XXXX/15 when funds were sufficient. According to XXXX and XXXX from Citizens '  New Mexico Phone Banking Department '', the fee was assessed because funds were insufficient on the day before ( XXXX/XXXX/15 ). I expressed to these representatives that, as a factor of dealing many times with Citizens and overdrafts in the past, we were closely watching for notifications of transactions on the evening of XXXX/XXXX/15. This is because we 've been told innumerable times by Citizens ' customer service representatives that, as long as we watch the online activity and ensure funds are sufficient by XXXX of each day, we will not incur any overdraft fees in the future. To be clear, there have been no notifications of transactions that caused our account to fall below zero dollars from the morning of XXXX/XXXX/15 up through to the present time which is XXXX/XXXX/15 at XXXX. In addition, I informed XXXX that we would have transferred money from our XXXX account ( via ATM 's ) if a notification had appeared online. Moreover, I even checked my account the morning of XXXX/XXXX/15 before going into school and nothing about this transaction was evident online. When I expressed this information to XXXX, the Supervisor, he then told me that  online banking is only a tool for customers '' and that it can not be completely relied upon for accuracy. This contradicts what I 've been told every single time I get an overdraft fee ( and it happens all the time honestly ) ; in fact, I was told this just within the last week or so when I incurred a different, unrelated overdraft fee. XXXX further declined to grant a reversal of the fee on the basis that they have been gracious enough with reversals in recent past encounters. I explained that the other transactions were irrelevant because this situation is unique, but he was not persuaded to help me. I feel that since funds were sufficient when the bank did process the check, an overdraft fee is just inappropriate, unfair, greedy, and overly punitive. Moreover, I 'd like to know if I am one of the bank 's customers from whose deposits they stole money over the last couple years. If so, this means I 'm going to be receiving money back from them in a lump sum. Depending on the amount to be returned, this could also mean that perhaps some or all of the overdraft fees incurred during this time period should be reversed in my favor. I also think it 's important that this same courtesy be given to every one of the customers from whom it stole money, along with a hand-written letter of apology. Please do what you can to help me as I am in XXXX XXXX and trying to keep bread on my table. I have only {$4.00} to my name right now as a consequence of this fee, and I may consider suing Citizens for emotional distress as well if this is not solved expediently.

3800,"Chase refused to investigate my complaint of fraudulent activity and credit {$3000.00} to my account as required by the Electronic Funds Transfer Act ( EFTA ). I am a XXXX year old XXXX woman from the XXXX. I have significant student debt and work part-time with a yearly salary of {$6000.00}. Because of Chase 's misconduct, I can not open a bank account at another bank and must rely on a prepaid card to receive wages. I am moving out of state next month and am unable to obtain affordable housing because this negative information is on my credit report.  On or around XXXX/XXXX/14, I lost my Chase debit card. Shortly after realizing this, I logged on to my mobile account and saw that XXXX unauthorized checks ( {$3000.00} ) were deposited and {$200.00} was withdrawn at an unfamiliar Chase branch ( XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX, see Ex. 1 ). Immediately thereafter, I went to the closest Chase branch ( XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX ) and spoke with the teller who informed me the acct. would be closed.  Despite Chase 's assurance that my account would be closed, on XXXX/XXXX/14 XXXX unauthorized transactions were posted to my account ( see Ex. 1 ) : XXXX ATM withdrawals ( totaling {$1000.00} ) from a Chase branch that I have never visited ( XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX ), and XXXX  card purchases with cash '' ( totaling {$1800.00} ) from an unfamiliar check cashing store in XXXX. On XXXX/XXXX/14, Chase took {$3000.00} from my account ( see  deposited item returns '' in Ex. 1 ). On XXXX/XXXX/14, I filed a dispute and received a response from Chase alleging that the withdrawals were authorized ( see Ex. 2 ). As proof, Chase provided me photocopies of the XXXX fraudulent checks endorsed with a forged signature ( see Ex. 3 ).  Prior to this incident, I had been a loyal Chase customer. Despite this, Chase did not follow the requirements of EFTA in investigating my fraud claim. I believe that Chase may have treated me this way because I am a person XXXX and/or a low income customer.  Section 909 ( b ) of EFTA states that the burden of proof is on the financial institution to show that the alleged fraudulent transaction was authorized. The OCC Comptroller 's Handbook on EFTA ( XXXX 2014 ) states  institutions can not assume that they have satisfied their duty to investigate simply by concluding that the customer 's debit card and PIN were used ... .rather, institutions must take steps to investigate whether there are indications that unauthorized use occurred. '' According to EFTA staff commentary ( Supp. I, 12 C.F.R. 205.11 ( c ) ( 4 ) -5 ), information that may be reviewed includes : - The transaction history of the particular account for a reasonable period of time immediately preceding the allegation of error. Previous authorized withdrawals from my account show a pattern of small-dollar ATM withdrawals of less than {$200.00} made once every few days or weeks. There is no pattern of same-day withdrawals of large sums of money ( more than {$1000.00} ). No previous authorized transactions were ever made from XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX or the XXXX XXXX Chase branch in XXXX.  - The location of either the transaction or the payee in question relative to the consumer 's place of residence and habitual transaction area. XXXX unauthorized same-day withdrawals ( {$1000.00} ) were made at a Chase branch located at XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX. This branch is located on the other side of the city and over an hour and a half away from my home in the XXXX.  - Any other information appropriate to resolve the claim. XXXX fraudulent checks were deposited and XXXX unauthorized ATM withdrawals were made at XXXX separate Chase branches ( see Ex. 1 ). Review of the security camera footage would show the transactions were not made by me.  A review of these items as part of an investigation under EFTA should have shown to Chase that the deposits and withdrawals on XX/XX/XXXX and XX/XX/XXXX respectively were fraudulent and unauthorized.

3808,"XXXX things are happening at TD Bank : First, they offer overdraft protection on checking accounts. They deliberately process transactions in an order that results in the highest fee. For example, if there is {$30.00} in a checking account, and a transaction for {$20.00} and XXXX for {$35.00} is put through. Regardless of which gets there first, they process the higher amount first and then the lower amount, creating XXXX overdraft fees. Also, they do not post overdraft fees at the time it occurs, but rather post it days later. So your online balance shows positive, but days later several overdraft fees are posted! And what you saw as a positive balance, really was not. I used the overdraft but have never had so many problems keeping my balance on the positive side!! And it 's the excessive number of overdraft fees that are being applied after the fact that is making it impossible.

The thief did try to buy things and succeeded at spending about {$50.00} on food but was declined from spending over {$400.00} at Target. When I called Chase, I informed them that my wallet had been stolen. I got all my credit and debit cards canceled and re-issued, however Chase did not put a fraud alert on my accounts. Then, 10 days later, someone went into a Chase branch in XXXX, IL and impersonated me using my license, forged my signature and withdrew almost all the money from my checking and savings accounts. I realized this two days later and went to a Chase branch in person to close all of my accounts. When I went to my local Chase branch, the banker I was working with actually admitted that it was negligent for them to have not put any fraud warning on my accounts when I told them that my wallet had been stolen. He also said it was very unusual for someone to actually walk into a bank and impersonate someone else and withdraw money. He helped me file claims and told me it would take 10 business days for me to be refunded. The Chase banker told me that Chase will do their own investigation to figure out how and why this teller allowed someone who was n't me to withdraw my money but also told me that I was n't allowed to know anything about the investigation - I would not be told any results. He told me they 'd have to  investigate '' to make sure that I was n't scamming them - pretending that my money was gone when in fact I had withdrawn it myself. I filed police reports and everything as well. Well, it has now been 13 business days and I have not been refunded. I just contacted Chase Claims department and without an apology they told me  it '' just was n't done yet, meaning the  investigation '' to make sure that I was n't making all this up. The woman on the phone acknowledged that it had been over their stated 10-day turnaround but offered me nothing else than a  you 'll have to call back in 2-3 days. They 're short-staffed over there. '' I was already really angry at Chase for a ) not putting a fraud alert on my account when they knew my wallet had been stolen and b ) allowing some teller to distribute my money to a criminal who had impersonated me and now I 'm utterly disgusted with them for their lack of concern, negligence and slowness in resolving what was a HUGE mistake on their part. And I do n't even know IF they will be reimbursing me - they may come back and say that they think I 'm scamming them. On top of all of this, I set up security questions to be asked when I call over the phone. I just called them today and was not asked any of the security questions - just my name and address. And guess what? The person who stole my wallet has all of that information and could have easily pretended to be me. Chase needs to implement some better security procedures, such as asking a security question when you go to withdraw large amounts of money, and actually implementing the security questions when they say they will.

So I went down to the bank and spoke with them and I repeatedly told them this was my account and it had nothing to do with the previous account that had already been closed this account is only in my name and has no ties to my mother or my deceased father 's previous account. After two weeks of contacting corporate and speaking with countless people and everybody saying that that 's not right that this ca n't happen then told me to speak with the District manager and that it was her decision so, to no avail on XX/XX/XXXX they withdrew {$20000.00} and gave it to my mother.

On any pay on death all parties must be present when account is closed she had and was there for his account to be closed I tried to obtain any of the sign documents from the bank but they informed me they do not keep any records and that they do not have any of the signed documents from my fathers account being closed.

I had pre-arranged thismeeting with XXXX XXXX XXXX a banker that I had known since I first started doing businessthere ). I explained to her that I would need a bill of sale notarized ( which she said she could do ) and told her about the mobile home and the realtor 's contract and since I had recently opened an account specifically to deposit money for this purchase, I feltthat I would be safe finalizing the purchase there. I was so wrong about that. I would findout. The Realtor and Seller were there before I got there. The process of getting the checkfrom the account was endless. They ( XXXX XXXX and XXXX men I did not know from thebank ) took well over an hour to present a check for {$15000.00} drawn from my account unlike any check I had ever seen before. The XXXX male bankers signed it, I did not. It was made out to the seller with no acknowledgement about the mobile home, my name was printed in the memo section. The check made me uncomfortable but, It had taken so long for them to produce the check that my questions about it were given short shrift. To continue, first, a few hours later I found out I was not given a clear Title. The Seller and Realtor had given me a Title that still listed the Sellers dead husband on it. That was taken care of but, a few hours later I discovered that there was No working air conditioning. I was told it just did not work very well and the weather was still cool until I bought it and so I offered less money for it. There had been a slight odor that seemed to come and go but, it now reeked horribly in the heat of the mobile home. The next morning I called customer service at TCF Bank and said I had to stop payment on the check if at all possible Immediately! I was told to go to the branch because yes, the check had not cleared and I could Absolutely Stop Payment. I raced to the bank only to be told by XXXX XXXX that NO I could not stop payment. She refused to stop payment no matter what I told her about the condition of the mobile home, the awful smell smell it had etc.  Instead she produced a letter stating if I stopped payment I would be guilty of perjury. This letter was from their XXXX XXXX XXXX, ready and waiting when I got there. XXXX XXXX was not alerted by me that I was coming. I called an attorney out of the phone book who told me I should certainly be able to stop payment ( it was my money ) and It was within a couple of days of the purchase etc. etc. XXXX was rude, threatening and nasty. I told her she was responsible for my losing {$15000.00}. She did not care. Customer service said she should have stopped payment and then told me I now would have to wait 90 days for any further action to be taken. I closed my savings account and left. I have since learned therewere numerous wrongs on the contract and that would have been ample reason to stop payment. I believe now that they would not do it because of the way they cut the check.

Some important points : 1 ) I informed Wells Fargo within minutes after I became aware of the charge. 2 ) This is a business account where I have money, but I often go some time without making a withdrawal. 3 ) I was sent a debit card for this account but I 'm quite sure I never intentionally activated it and I know for sure I have never used it ( the card was shredded shortly after receiving it ). No credit card or line of credit is associated with this account. 4 ) The charge I disputed is the only charge on that account for XX/XX/XXXX ( there were also no charges in XX/XX/XXXX ). I have since moved most money from that account out of concern that fraudulent activity might resume. XXXX ) I do n't know the source of the charge. Wells Fargo has not told me if they consider the charge to be a debit-card charge, a credit-card charge, or some other type of transfer ( the first XXXX should not be possible ). I presume it 's not a check since no image is posted online. 6 ) Lacking information from Wells Fargo, I do n't know how to contact the source of the charge -- I ca n't find them online from the information provided -- and I do n't know whether this is simply a mistake or fraudulent activity. 7 ) Wells Fargo indicated that they made no attempt to ascertain whether or not the charge was fraudulent or an error. Their investigation was limited to whether or not I had noticed the charge in time. 8 ) The idea that I have to monitor my account every day and notify the bank of any unauthorized activity within 24 hours is outrageous, especially on an account that has not had authorized transactions for XX/XX/XXXX and XX/XX/XXXX ( with the exception of a deposit and transfers made because of this potentially fraudulent activity ). 9 ) I checked the account on XX/XX/XXXX to see if a deposit made on XX/XX/XXXX had been posted. Even though I 've been making deposits for more than 20 years from the same highly reputable source, Wells Fargo often arbitrarily puts holds on deposits. So I do check those. 10 ) I notified Wells Fargo of the unauthorized charged before receiving a statement for the month. I do review the statement monthly and it 's my expectation that is the time to look for concerns with Wells Fargo 's management of the account and that any clock that starts on notification should start with the statement or a communication from Wells Fargo.

Time line of events are as follows:XX/XX/2015 I pay down my personal line of credit to {$0.00}.  XXXX/XXXX/15 I go to transfer funds from my personal line of credit to my business account and unable to do so. Call Coastal personal banker to do this and she is unable to make the transfer. She researches why she can not transfer this for the next 2-3 hours and finally calls back stating that the account has been frozen due to the credit report underwriting ran on XXXX/XXXX/15, showing a judgment. The credit report states that the reasons for their decision are as follows : Serious Delinquency and public record or collection filed  Length of time since derogatory public record or collection is too short.

I tell her that this judgment was vacated and deleted from my records on XXXX/XXXX/15, thus we should be able to reinstate my accounts immediately.

This obviously pulls my credit score down. Another thing I reiterate is the fact that I have a Coastal HELOC in place ( with a high balance ), that is dropping my score as well.

3946,"XXXX XXXX I set up a joint account for my mother and I. We needed a way to share funds because we are purchasing a house together. I signed up for an account online. I received an email stating I needed to send a bank statement to verify my identity, so I sent XXXX. I later received a call saying that was n't good enough because they tried calling my credit union to verify my information but the credit union would n't share information. Why call my credit union when everyone knows they 're not going to give out my information? Why ever ask for the bank statement in the first place if the statement itself was n't enough?   So then they asked for more information. I clearly explained to the person on the phone that I was at a new address and did not have any bills at the new address yet and my license still had my old address. He said I could send a copy of my license and a copy of a bill for the current address with my roommate 's info and that would be sufficient. I sent XXXX items and did not get a request for any additional information.   Then last week I got a check in the mail for my account balance and notification that my account was closed. When I called to find out why, they said the information was not sufficient. I asked why and they could not explain why because the notes did n't have any details. Then they said they could reopen the account. So I waited for a personal banker to get on the line, we went through my request, and they said I would be contacted within 1-2 days to let me know what information they needed to finish reopening the account.   A week later I had n't heard from anything so I called back. After 10 minutes on the phone, someone finally said that I could not reopen an account that had been opened online. Why was I told differently the previous week? Why did I waste a week waiting for a phone call that was never going to come? They want me to start the process all over without being able to explain to me why the previous documents were not enough and what I can do differently to make sure the account opens correctly. They want me to risk wasting a bunch of time trying to open this account again. I have now wasted a month and a half trying to set up an account.

I spoke with Supervisor XXXX XXXX Employee ID # XXXX XXXX whom reached out to the check receiving department on my behalf to see what they could do.

The explanation was that when the bank that cashed the check XXXX XXXX XXXX sent the cashed check to capital one, XXXX entered in the wrong check number which in this case is XXXX. I was told that Capital One policy dictates that check detail information received from the bank that cashed the check had to stay intact in my online transaction history and also on my checking account statement even if that detail information was inaccurate.  I posed a hypothetical scenario XXXX. What if the Bank that cashed the check incorrectly coded the check number as XXXX? Since Capital one policy requires that information be kept intact when reflected in my transaction History and my checking account statement, would n't check # XXXX show up on my statement and transaction history? She agreed that according to policy, yes, XXXX would incorrectly show up on my statement as well as transaction history. I then asked that since Capital One policy states that statements ca n't be corrected, would n't I be stuck with a Bank statement that showed incorrect information for that hypothetical check transaction where check XXXX showed as check XXXX. She agreed that It would. This hypothetical situation is no different than the situation I am in now. Whether it 's check XXXX or check XXXX, the fact is that the transaction detail is wrong and I do n't have accurate documentation for my business transaction on my Bank statement.

I immediately mailed a letter to USAA to voice my concerns and to gets some answer about counterfeit checks and why all the money was release for the theft to withdraw from the account. Why the fraud department did not alert me or my wife if they could not get in touch with my son. They held us liable, but gave us no opportunity to stop the illegal transactions.

4014,"To whom this may concern, I am writing to the CFPB in attempts to resolve an ongoing dispute between myself and Scottrade Bank. Briefly, my Scottrade Bank was hacked because of poor security and data handling policies and Scottrade Bank has refused to honor their Online Security Guarantee listed here : XXXXI am specifically writing in to better understand Scottrade Bank 's policies on examining fraud that may have been a result of a combined phishing and remote access tool (  RAT '' ) hack.   For background, at the time of the hack my laptops were security with antivirus and personal information was never shared. I always took security precautions to keep my personal information safe. However, Scottrade Bank did not give me the same courtesy and at one point instructed me to send personal information over an insecure email server.   Upon information and belief, and months of forensic analysis it have been determined that the likely method of the hack was the marriage of a remote access tool ( delivered via socially engineered email ) and leaked personal information that could be easily bought and sold on internet. Indeed, examining various emails in my inbox showed that a number of phishing attempts were made and although anti-virus was installed it is very easy to  crypt '' or  encode '' a virus to be fully undetectable. Indeed, at the time of the hacking most anti-virus software was unable to detect a very common and maliciously used version of XXXX RAT which as the FBI had previously announced has been used in numerous financial account hacks. It is clear that the use of a RAT in combination with the information Scottrade Bank leaked insecure emails and or left insecure via database vulnerabilities resulted in the hacking or at least contributed to the hacking of my Scottrade Bank account.   It is worth noting that Scottrade Bank did not flag any of the enormously unusual transactions accumulating to over {$800000.00} and suspicious even though they were unequivocally out of the accounts normal behavioral patters and not within the limits of the customer consider the Know-Your-Customer information, such as salary, debt, and profession submitted to Scottrade Bank.   I am writing to Scottrade Bank to better understand how Scottrade Bank defends against ubiquitous RAT viruses commonly used in financial account takeovers. In the instance I described above, Scottrade Bank even refused to analyze my computer despite there being signs of virus activity. Furthermore, Scottrade Bank internally and externally recognizes the existence of RATs and has been warned of the potential of illicit account takeovers via RATs through various financial regulatory briefings and financial cooperation events.   Presumably, given the fair and ample warning Scottrade Bank received about RATs I am curious as to why Scottrade Bank still relies on a  Multi-Factor '' and not  out of band '' authentication techniques that have no way of distinguishing or fail to distinguish between legitimate customer behavior and fraudulent account takeovers.   In this case Scottrade Bank relies on information given from a XXXX security tool known as  XXXX Multi Factor Authentication '', this tool provides no ability to distinguish between a RAT and a legitimate customer because it only logs computer information and relies on insecure plain-text  secondary questions '' which are by default remembered within the browser history of a computer, such that a computer infected with a RAT gives a hacker all of the information needed to infiltrate an online account. As a result this is a failed layer of security and it gets worse.   Scottrade has no  behavioral '' red flags that indicate whether a transaction might be suspicious or not. For example, in the instance above, the account was hacked and multiple {$200000.00} ACH transfer were initiated ...   ",zhan1565@purdue.edu,1

( XXXX, I intended to close a checking account at the TCF Bank located in XXXX, XXXX XXXX, IL because I was being assessed a fee for not maintaining an account balance I was not told about. ) I was convinced to try another product - no interest with no minimum or fees. I agreed to keep my money at TCF, but specifically requested to not have checks or a debit cards issued. I wanted to withdraw cash directly. TCF Bank proceeded to assess a fee for checks I did not order ( they reversed the fees after I complained ) and apparently issued a debit card for the account which I do not remember ever receiving.  Flash forward, I receive a Notice of Overdraft or Adjustment letter dated XX/XX/XXXX stating my account with TCF was overdrawn by {$410.00}. I knew that was impossible because I had not withdrawn cash from the account since XX/XX/XXXX. I immediately called their customer service and was instructed to go to the branch the next day and file a Regulation E/Electronic Transaction Unauthorized Use Claim, which I did. I receive several other Overdraft letters dated XX/XX/XXXX ( {$1200.00} ), XX/XX/XXXX ( XXXX ), XX/XX/XXXX ( XXXX. ) After calling very upset that TCF 1 ) PERMITTED DEBIT CARD TRANSACTIONS ON MY ACCOUNT WHEN I HAD NOT REQUESTED A DEBIT CARD AND IT WAS NOT NORMAL OR CUSTOMARY FOR THE ACCOUNT, 2 ) CONTINUED TO PROCESS TRANSACTIONS AND ASSESS OVERDRAFT FEES AFTER THE ACCOUNT WAS ALREADY OVERDRAWN, and 3 ) DOES NOT HAVE A QUICK REMEDY OR INVESTIGATION PROCESS WHEN AN ACCOUNT IS COMPLETELY DEPLETED. On XX/XX/XXXX TCF bank notified me a provisional credit of {$4500.00} for disputed transactions, and {$140.00} Service fee reversal would be given.  I THINK TCF IS HOLDING MY MONEY WITHOUT CAUSE. I want to transfer my account to another bank, but am told the balance is provisional and the investigation can take until XX/XX/XXXX. TCF knows I filed a police report and made calls to venders on XX/XX/XXXX and XX/XX/XXXX, and THE VENDORS AGREE THE TRANSACTIONS WERE NOT MADE BY ME. XXXX vender, XXXX XXXX Floor in XXXX, WI XXXX charge of {$3700.00} ) said they have an employee that remembers the transaction and carrier ( a man with XXXX XXXX XXXX ) that picked up the order, and has a receipt but signature is illegible.

Per XXXX, the debit card was called in, they have surveillance, and an employee that remembers the man and car who picked up the order. He also acknowledged the transaction was not made by me. With just a few phone calls, TCF could easily determine the transactions were made fraudulently and fully release my money. I think it is wrong that TCF has not fully released my money, so I can close the account and move to another bank that has better systems in place to prevent fraud and track record of releasing funds in a timely manner.

4062,"This is my fourth complaint about overdraft fees on my account. I am attaching documentation to show that Key Bank changes the order of credits and debits to accounts. I would appreciate someone from the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau to closely look at my documentation this time as I have copied my account over the last two days to show the discrepancies in accounting. This last overdraft I received because I moved XXXX $ from my standard checking to my son 's Hassle Free account. The reason my account over drew in the first place two days ago was because of the fees debited by Key Bank. On the ledger there is no sign of overdraft before the fees were debited. In response to the overdraft complaint yesterday, Key Bank sent a tutorial with a fictitious person named XXXX who is XXXX XXXX and very young. The tutorial says that she over drew her account buying coffee and donuts. Besides the very problematic racialization of XXXX, Key Bank blames the customer when actually what is happening is that Key Bank alters the timing of debits and credits in ways that incur overdrafts. My ledger shows several deposits in the last few days yet they mysteriously move around in the ledger as do debits. Once an overdraft is debited in accounts that are fragile ( meaning no overdraft protection attached and low balances ) these fees throw the account into disarray resulting in yet more overdraft fees. Please CFP look carefully at my account. I am not some crazy person continuing to complain. I am an educated woman who follows her account diligently and I am going to continue to complain because I know if this is happening to me, it 's happening to others who perhaps do not have the money to pay the fees.

If you make a deposit or withdrawal they will move the dates in order for them to collect more fees. I actually have proof of this happening in my account.

I made an immediate withdrawal of {$1800.00} from a local branch which USAA partners with to obtain a cashier 's check in the entire amount withdrawn, similar to an ATM withdrawal but due to the amount it needs to be completed this way per USAA. However, my USAA account statement shows the withdrawal was made on XXXX/XXXX/2015 which is a significant deficit of days and cashiers checks are immediate. I kept all receipts of withdrawals to prove this. I also paid a bill which cleared after a deposit I made in the morning of the XXXX XXXX only to have it magically appear before the deposit, even though it was n't made until after the deposit was made. My next instance happened on XXXX/XXXX/2015 when I deposited via my phone a US Postal money order in the amount of {$310.00} in the morning at approximately XXXX XXXX it was later that day after my deposit which is immediate when made from the mobile device that one of my auto drafts for billing cleared. Once again my account was manipulated and my deposit was moved to after the ACH draft attempted to clear as to make it appear that no funds were available at that time so USAA in turn could charge me an overdraft fee. Then when my check which was written out to my housekeeper in the amount of {$85.00} cleared they once again manipulated my account and charged me not once but twice overdraft fees when you can clearly see on my account statement there were funds available and the check itself did clear the first time. When I spoke with a customer service rep, they told me they could not fix it because it was their computer who processes and they can only see the process. Now, if it is my money and I can see that enough is there to clear any debits or checks they can not do things behind the scenes in order to make more money.

The merit of XXXX refusing my business is highly questionable, but in any case, they have refused to allow me to redeem my gift cards, even though they are, by legal definition, something a consumer purchases in return for guaranteed consideration for goods and services. Regardless of that fact, they would not refund my money. I opened a case with the PNC bank rewards people, and after 60 days of runaround, they finally informed me that they will not accept the cards for return. According to their terms and conditions, one of the only circumstances under which a reward can be returned is if the reward becomes unavailable after a consumer orders it. So I ordered it, and that reward became unavailable to me afterward ( before I received it in XXXX, 2015 ). They should take the cards back and refund my points balance. It is unacceptable for a consumer to be left in a position where they 've paid cash equivalent for something and yet get nothing for it. XXXX should not be allowed to deny the use of valid gift cards, and PNC Bank should not be allowed to deny me returning a reward that has become completely unusable before I ever even received it. The bank uses rewards programs to attract and retain customers as well as entice them to spend money on credit cards. PNC Bank succeeded at doing this to me, yet failed to provide a reward of the value guaranteed as part of the rewards program.   ",jmccror@purdue.edu,0

This caused my account to accumulate XXXX additional fees than if they had paid the items smallest to largest first. The reasoning the representatives give over the phone is  we consider the higher dollar items more important in pay order than lower dollar items '' meaning that if they were going to reject payment of an Item they would rather reject payment of the smaller items than the big item. Of course this makes no sense because even after paying the largest item first they still pay the smaller items and still collect extra fees and nothing ever gets rejected on my account because they know with my direct deposit that money coming in is a sure thing.

So I went to my local branch and inquired, the agent told me my accounts looked fine and I must have been charged in error. At this point I believed the problem to be resolved.

TD 's response  While you are not charged an overdraft fee for a pending authorization, even if it brings your balance negative, the authorized funds are deducted from your available funds. '' It seems that the consumer IS being charged for pending transactions. Technically those funds should still be available for use for other transactions since the merchant has not sent it through for payment and IF when those pending items come to post in the future they THEN should be assessed fees should funds be unavailable.I was told it was assessed to a {$10.00} transfer to my other TD Bank account I share with my son.

I have requested from the bank the {$100.00} in fees be refunded as the information that I see online is inconsistent with the information they communicate AFTER they 're assessed the fee.

They told us that someone had deposited a check electronically and removed the money from our account. We informed them that my family does not use checks, and the only money we put into our account is from Federal Agencies ( pay checks ). Then we found out what we needed to do to dispute this fraudulent activity. NFCU told us that if we went and got a police report and brought it in we would be refunded in less than 48 hours.   After obtaining the police report we brought it in to the branch in XXXX, GA. They said okay it will be refunded in less than 48 hours. 48 hours passed with no action. So three days later we called. Then we were informed that a gentleman and myself, XXXX XXXX, had showed up with the check at the branch in XXXX Georgia on XXXX XXXX, 2015, went to the counter and made the transaction. So therefore they would deny the fraud claim. But they stated they wanted an affidavit saying that I was not present in the location on XXXX XXXX, 2015, because they wanted to look at the cameras to see if it was actually me that showed up in the branch. We completed the Affidavit and gave it to the branch, but they refused to accept this affidavit and wanted me to sign XXXX provided by them. The next day our claim was denied again.   When we called to learn why they had denied our claim again, they told us that the man had come into the branch alone on XXXX XXXX, 2015, and that he was to deposit a check into our account and withdraw the cash value of the check. The check was made out for {$1500.00} and was made out to me. They said that NFCU called me to receive authority for the transaction to take place and that I authorized it. I did not receive a phone call from them and I did not authorize the transaction, but NFCU used their story to deny our claim again.   After this denial, NFCU confiscated XXXX of my pay checks, as well as my children 's savings accounts and froze our account.

In order to avoid any returned checks or transactions, I was prohibited from making any transfers of my own. This allegation that I exceed the XXXX transaction per month is the furthest from the truth and has caused me financial hardships of authorized e-checks being returned, my account being charge overdraft fees, and thus my checking account going into the negative.

4166,"I have XXXX x J.P. Morgan Chase bank accounts.   J.P. Morgan Chase offers an 'alert service ' to their customers to reduce fraud, and in particular, to ensure that - should an account not have sufficient funds available - a customer is instantly 'alerted ' so as to be able to transfer or add funds to their account/s in time for a payment to be processed successfully.   This 'alert ' service is widely advertised as a part of the benefits of being a Chase banking or credit card customer.   Note that this alert service does require some 'setting up ', which I have done, and used successfully prior to this incident.   From XXXX XXXX 2015, the Chase alert service stopped working completely on all my accounts and Chase credit cards, and I have incurred substantial fees as a result of not receiving notifications of insufficient funds that would otherwise allow me to transfer or add funds in time to avoid such fees. Prior to this, I have used this service ritually with few issues, but on XXXX XXXX/XXXX/15, it began to fail completely, and Chase began to charge me ISF fees as a result.   Once I realised the issue, I contacted Chase Customer Service, and they insisted that their system was 'working fine ', and that I should set up alerts via 'Push ', Text and email just to be certain. I followed their advice and did so, ( receiving no less than XXXX emails confirming these changes to my alerts. However, despite setting up all alerts via all means, none of them worked at all. Meanwhile, Chase continued to charge me ISF fees, ignored my concerns raised, told me the alerts were just a 'free service ' to me, and were unwilling to assist any further.   After several calls, emails and texts about the issue to my Chase account manager - XXXX XXXX - he finally requested I come in to demonstrate the issue to him on XXXX/XXXX/15. While in his presence, he checked my alert settings, and then had me perform XXXX x transactions. The Chase alert system failed completely for both, so he agreed it was an issue and pledged to report it to 'National ' customer service for a full refund of the fees.   To date, none of the fees have been refunded to the account that was used for demonstrating the issue, and as a result, my account/s remain in negative balance. Chase calls and writes constantly to add funds so as to bring my account/s back into credit, but I refuse to do so, as adding funds would serve only to pay Chase their ISF fees, and I am certain any request for refund would be denied.

After responding I was sent a letter of instruction and a cashier 's check for {$2900.00} in a USPS overnight envelope from XXXX XXXX in XXXX, NJ. I was told to keep {$400.00} and transfer {$2500.00} at a XXXX XXXX XXXX to their contact in XXXX XXXX. They were interested in various customer feedback. The cashier 's check was from the XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX based in XXXX XXXX, TX, according to their website a {$6.00} XXXX credit union. I do not know the intricacies of how cashier 's checks are cleared. I thought they were cash when you deposit them. Still I thought the situation was unusual. When I received the letter and check I called Citibank 's customer service line. After 20 minutes on the phone where I asked if there were any known scams I was told to take the check to a local branch for verification. It seemed to make sense. However if you go to the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency website ( XXXX ) it states that you should never accept a check from someone you do n't know and that as the payee it is up to you to pursue the maker of the check. Like being mislead that a red and green traffic light have the opposite meaning. I then went to a local Citibank branch and spoke to a teller who I had seen before and asked if they could review the cashier 's check since it was from an out of state credit union. I was told that the funds that were posted and cleared. I was told that the cash from the check was available now. Later that day I went to another Citibank branch in nearby and again confirmed the cash balance and withdrew the {$2500.00} and proceeded with my assignment. Three business days later I saw that my checking account balance was reduced by {$2900.00}. I called the Citibank and was transferred to their fraud dept. and now the learning began. I was told that all cashier 's checks even those from another Citibank account are on HOLD for one business day. Any cashier 's check from a non-Citibank account can take up to four business days for verification. I called Citibank customer service to reach the manager of the local branch. It turns out that this branch does n't have a manager. They did n't have an assistant manager on the day I called, they were on vacation. I was referred to a Citibank location 15 minutes away to the supervising manager who had his day off. I spoke to the assistant manager who was on the teller line. I then was referred to the area manager who told me that they would give the teller that I dealt with additional training. I asked about the bank 's responsibility and why I was misled. I was told that it was up to me to know. I received the attached form letter from Citibank absolving them from any responsibility. If there is n't adequate supervision, there is n't adequate training and the bank can save time and money because they have the OCC rule discussed above to hide behind. It 's a fraudster 's paradise.

I woke up on Wednesday morning the XX/XX/XXXX to an email notification from the bank that the deposit was put on hold. I went down to the Wells Fargo branch that I deposited the check out to clear the hold. The branch manager notified me that the hold was placed on XX/XX/XXXX and that the reason for the hold was that during the year I had a few overdraft charges. She also told me that the decision to hold the deposit was decided upon at their home office. Where ever that is. My complaint with Wells Fargo concerning this manner is XXXX fold. First off, they know its the holiday season and that people are spending money on gifts. By withholding deposits and not immediately notifying the consumer they allow the consumer to unknowingly overdraw their accounts. The decision to withhold the deposit days after the check was processed by the bank is highly suspicious. By the XXXX of the month the check should have been well cleared. Because I had overdrawn the account before I seemed like a easy victim for them to pull their scam on. When I approached the bank manager about this issue, within a minute she was able to release the hold on the deposit from her computer without any protest. If the bank had any real concerns about this as a long term issue then why would me telling them to release the hold be enough for them to release the hold. I also find the reasoning for the hold to be dubious in the extreme. To state the reason for the hold was because of overdrafts, then not allow a deposit into the account would seem counter-intuitive. Unless of course the bank wants the clients to have more overdrafts, which it does because it then slaps a {$20.00} charge on each overdraft. Wells Fargo 's actions in this situation are deplorable and should be held with utter contempt. It seems rather clear from my perspective that Wells Fargo was looking for an opportunity to slap additional charges on me by unlawfully controlling the timing in which deposits are allowed into the account.

I called and spoke to XXXX and they sent me a letter to send over to wells fargo explaining the situation to hopefully have the NSF fees removed off the account but Wells Fargo would n't accept the email I tried to send to them and would n't even speak to me about the fee 's over the phone at all so I now already paid the transactions that I did n't even know were going to be charged to my bank and now have a XXXX $ bill for Wells Fargo because they choose to charge me XXXX $ for less than a XXXX $ transaction that they never even paid is there any way to fight this I still have the email letter from XXXX regarding the incident as well if that helps at all!

4309,"Essentially this is NOT my XXXX complaint about Wells Fargo Bank. They treated me like dirt when I was robbed a few yrs ago  wanted a HELOC loan as I was robbed of all my money, ID, etc. In any event, they lent me $ XXXX at 29.99 % with the understanding that THEY would deduct the monthly payment from my WF checking. Before I got that XXXX loan, they hit my credit reports XXXX hard inquiries in 3 wks. I complained to the CEO 's office  had to deal with the CEO complaint dept in AZ. They were ok, but did nothing to really help. I just figured I 'd let it go after I got removed all but XXXX of their HARD inquiries. Everyone knows a hard inquiry goes against your credit by about XXXX pts apiece ( they tell you XXXX pts ). OK, other problems with their ethics or lack thereof, but I recently sold a property  decided I was going to pay down ALL my open credit accts.XXXX, WF who was  supposed '' to take the money out of my checking for the payment ( their own bank checking ), on purpose my guess, took it out 1-2 days early. I do n't keep much in checking there ( at least {$5.00} because they took over my local bank that went bankrupt and was no charge but WF decided to charge {$5.00} if you keep less than average of {$1500.00} ). I am a senior citizen so I choose not to put any in WF but minimal. Several times, WF took payment early ( even though they knew I deposited a check from another bank  it was there  visible to me ), but they said money was not there so the  PAID '' to the personal line of credit. In paying to that personal line of credit, they charged me an OVERDRAFT fee each time of {$35.00} even though the money had been put in their bank ( they also HOLD CASH from XXXX inside WF acct to another JUST TO GET ANOTHER DAY OF INTEREST ). OK, I paid {$1200.00} from my WF checking on the XXXX, done online instant transfer to the loan account ( it showed PENDING for 3 days ... XXXX XXXX XXXX does not do that ). I then decided to put XXXX in my WF checking to pay another $ XXXX on that loan. So, I paid {$3200.00} on that loan knowing they put another HOLD or PENDING on the money transferred from their own acct. I just went in to transfer {$500.00} from my WF checking to that same WF loan. It says of course ... PENDING ( it 's cash for goodness sake!  their cash ). OK, I happened to look  noticed the change  I have not been notified by them, but I noticed it said all of the entire loan had {$390.00} available. Well when you pay as much as I have in 2 wks, I knew that was wrong. I looked  GOOD OLE WF BANK had lowered the amt of the loan from XXXX to XXXX ( of course with full intent in my opinion of destroying my credit ). I had XXXX bank do that a couple of yrs ago. So unethical. HOWEVER, at the time of this complaint, they have not bothered to tell me they have done this. I just happened to see that the amount of loan is $ XXXX  amount available is {$390.00} They are scum! I decided I am going to go into WF Bank on Mon.  pay the remainder in cash  close the acct. They are an unethical bank, will do anything to take a random $ XXXX in fees, PLUS they have a borrowing fee of no less than $ XXXX on this loan acct. I AM GOING TO CLOSE THE ACCT WHEN I BRING THE CASH TO THEM ON MON. I am just wondering if they will refuse the payoff. I do n't want any more money from that bank. They  claim '' they can not see the payments you make from other banks, but can they not see the payments you make from their own bank?? I 'm XXXX yrs old  I am highly ethical. It unnerves me to no end when you have worked hard for 42 yrs ( as I have )  are treated so bad by A BANK W/NO ETHICS.

Specifically, in going through my records in order to better understand how I could resolve ongoing identity theft, I discovered that when applying for a bank account at Scottrade Bank, Scottrade Bank improperly handled a number of documents which had very personal information on them. The actions of Scottrade Bank not only broke from the current standards of data security but also broke Scottrade Bank 's internal policies regarding handling customer information.   Specifically, on or around XXXX XXXX, 2013 XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX XXXX, a regional manager from Scottrade Bank offered to receive Scottrade Bank account application documents via email.

The XXXX XXXX, 2013 email contained PDF attachments that included my full name, signature, address, bank account numbers, Social Security Number, and other very personal and sensitive information.

4344,"My wife has just gotten her SSN and found a job at XXXX. In order to get her payments, we wanted to open a new checking account. I searched if there was any bonuses for new account customers. I found First Tennessee Bank, which gives {$250.00} bonus for their online applicants. I filled out an application for her, at the end of the process the system told me that her identification is not verified and we need to go to a branch so as to further the application.  We went to the nearest branch of First Tennessee Bank and told them ( a customer representative ) the situation. She told us that she can not further that application on branch, it should be done by online. She offered us some other options, one of them was offering {$150.00} for new checking account customers who meet their criteria. Even though I accepted her offer, I still wanted to ask her why the application which I started online can not be progressed? If the branch can not further it, why did the e-mail told us to continue on the application with a branch? Then, the representative slightly agreed with me and called the phone number provided in the e-mail that First Tennessee Bank sent us during the online application process. The other representative on the call told the representative on the branch that they can not verify my wife 's identity, in other words her SSN is not valid! After the call, the branch representative suggested us to go to Social Security Office and ask them if there is anything wrong with my wife 's information. I wanted her to open the account by herself on branch. She told me that it is not possible to open a checking account once it is declined by the online banking system, even though she was saying that she can open an account ( she already knew that our online application was declined ) in the branch before that call! So, she basically did not want to open that account. Probably, she thought that opening an account for my wife is risky!  I went to Social Security Office with my wife and spent our 1 hour over there in order to ask them what is wrong with my wife 's SSN. The social security officer told us that there is nothing wrong. All of my wife 's information matches with their system. He added that First Tennessee Bank maybe did not want to open an account for us/my wife and sent us to the office so as to throw overboard, which was very logical idea for me.  After leaving the office, I called the First Tennessee Bank Online Account Service and told them the situation. They did not even want to listen to me and repeatedly told me that they are sorry and they can not help me with the situation.  After all these conversations were made and we lost our whole day by trying to deal with these narrow-minded and under-educated people, we came home and I started to search for the reasons why I had this problem. I found the core problem on another bank 's website, which is saying that if you have just gotten your SSN and do not have any background, please go to our branches. After reading this warning, I understood that she needed to have credit history in order to open an Online Checking Account. However, any of the representatives have not told us anything about this. If the case is a credit history for a checking account, which does not damage the bank, but benefits, why do n't they even help us in the branch? This is a customer disappointment. Having this bad experience with First Tennessee bank and being a person who worked at a bank for two years, I am calling this situation disgraceful for First Tennessee Bank. I have felt like we are 3rd ( or even worse ) class of people in this country, who are not wanted in here! For this reason, I wanted to tell my complaint will all the details. Tomorrow, I will go to another branch of First Tennessee Bank and try to open an account for my wife again just to see what they are going to do. I just want my rights!   ",wu467@purdue.edu,0

On or about XXXX XXXX, 2014, I updated USAA.com with the new checking account number while paying my current USAA credit card bill. At that time I was unaware that USAA.com failed to update my linked checking account number to the newly issued account number. The following month I attempted to make a payment in the amount of {$1000.00}. I was under the impression that this payment, like the last, was without issue. Each time that I had submitted the payment via XXXX, it was my understanding that the payment had processed. I was unaware of the error until logging onto USAA.com on third month to pay my USAA credit card bill and seeing a balance that did not match my personal recordkeeping.

I contacted USAA to discuss this issue and I had made my way to a senior account manager.

I followed the instructions given to me by that account representative exactly. I mailed in the  USAA Credit Dispute Form '' along with all of the documentation the USAA representative had identified was required.  To my surprise, the response to my dispute was not the expected details of dispute resolution, but rather, I received a general letter stating that USAA had done an investigation and found that it is reporting events accurately. I take issue with USAA responding to the formal dispute with a general letter that failed to provide any reference to my particular issue, and furthermore, I find it appalling that my conversation with a senior account representative would be in direct contradiction to the final determination.  I challenge USAA to conduct a proper review of my dispute. I am positive that if a proper review is conducted, and all relevant information is taken into account, USAA will recognize my dispute as valid and move quickly to clear it 's adverse credit reporting.

4427,"PNC Bank got sued for improper business practices during the past XXXX years. In that time, I had XXXX separate accounts that were affected. The first time PNC began to steal money from their customers, I paid approximately {$200.00} to reopen my first account after it fell negative. It fell negative because the bank was improperly charging overdraft fees to make accounts fall below zero before transactions were being processed so they would get a bonus overdraft fee ( XXXX total ) from XXXX ( XXXX ) transaction.   The second time it happened ( negative {$200.00} again ) I realized what type of scam was being conducted - it was complete fraud given the technology that exists in this world ( automated/computerized time-stamping of transactions ). After the lawsuit was completed I received less than 5 % of the original amount I deposited from the first incident and still had the debt from the second incident.   For the past 9 years I have been unable to open a bank account because PNC bank has a XXXX entry regarding the fraudulent debt they imposed on my account. If the lawsuit judge ruled that the bank was at fault, how come the XXXX entry has not been removed and PNC is requiring payment of the fraudulent debt? Can they be fined for this type of practice - I am sure there are many other people in the exact same situation ( just like the first time PNC started their fraudulent banking practices ). Can we give clean records back to all the people who have been affected by fraudulent business activities such as this one? Is a second class action lawsuit needed to resolve a fraudulent {$200.00} debt that never should have existed and to resolve everybody 's XXXX problem? What percentage of Americans right now are barred from using bank checking accounts because of fraudulent practices like what PNC did?   What percentage of those people are minorities or non-white? Is there an abnormality or improper proportionality in this statistic? Who is in charge of fraudulent banking activity anyway? I called the PNC bank and spoke with a representative who told me the only way to fix anything is to take PNC Bank to small claims court. Why does a citizen have to take a bank to court when the United States Government has already declared that bank a thief and required them to pay up a tiny percentage of the money they stole? Why should anybody have to repay a bank to get their record clean when the US Government completely agrees with the consumer. Can the US Government fine XXXX and PNC bank for stealing from honest hard working Americans?   Maybe that is why the US Economy is having a rough time - banks are stealing too much. A little fraud can go undetected for an incredibly long time but a lot of fraud is noticeable immediately. If the entire United States economy has noticed this type of fraud, are we not supposed to be able to protect ourselves from thieves inside of our own country? Is the US Government not supposed help citizens when there is a monopoly that is causing issues and grief within the public.   How does a bank steal money from US citizens in the midst of a recession, then get a bail out from congress for billions of dollars, while at the same time continuously playing predator toward poor, underprivileged, and minority citizens?

4477,"My husband and I a joint checking account at Bank of America, in XXXX, VA. The Bank allowed one of our check payees to cash the same check twice. In fact, the Bank allowed this payee to do this five different times, over a four-month period, for a total of {$1900.00}. I have the supporting documentation, including the record of the checking account debits and the duplicate check images that the Bank included in our checking account statements. I called the Bank 's fraud department today. The first person said it is not possible for a check to be cashed twice ; the system is designed to catch that. When I presented her with the evidence, she transferred me to the Bank 's check fraud department. The woman there said that because I wrote the checks in question, that was not fraud on the Bank and that I would have to go to the police to get my money back. When I told her that I was a lawyer and gave her the definition of fraud, she took my information and said that the Bank would be sending me the forms to file a claim, which would be reviewed by a claims analyst. She said I would get the forms within seven to ten business days. She suggested that I might want to close my account. I will file the claim, and I will get my money back. But I am appalled that Bank of America 's system allows the same check to be deposited twice. I am also appalled that neither of the Bank 's fraud department representatives appeared to view this as a serious customer security problem and that neither representative appeared interested in following up on the systems security issue. The woman in the check fraud department surmised that the payee had first deposited each check using a mobile app and then later deposited the hard copy of the check in an ATM. The checks were cashed in different check statement periods. So, the Bank 's representative working in the check fraud department believes that it is possible for a payee to deposit a check using a mobile app and then later to deposit the hard copy of the same check. But she apparently does n't think that is a serious security systems problem!!!   ",zhan1565@purdue.edu,1

The second beneficiary designation was located by them only after they had repeatedly represented that there was No such record. They have also incorrectly ( intentionally or negligently ) represented that there is no detriment since they are willing to pay the IRA to the Estate. The Bank should be aware of the detrimental tax consequence of the payment to an Estate rather than a person beneficiary -- even if ignorant they should at least not make false statements on which their depositors may rely to their detriment. My mother was not a wealthy woman ; she carefully saved her money and meticulously set up her accounts in accordance with her wishes.

First, They purposely held pending transactions that the merchant had already sent through. Meaning they held pending transactions so that my account would incur NSF fees totaling {$150.00} which far exceed the amount of the total of my transactions which totaled {$30.00}. They also switched the amount owed from {$250.00} to {$150.00} to trick me, the account holder, into believing that I owe more to TD BANK when in fact I owed less.

TD BANK CONTINUED TO PAY THEM EVEN THOUGH I INFORMED THEM AND FILLED OUT PAPERWORK THAT I DO NOT WANT TO PAY IT. TD BANK LIED AND INFORMED ME THAT I FILLED OUT THE WRONG PAPER WORK, BUT THEY WERE THE ONES THAT GAVE ME THE PAPERWORK TO BEGIN WITH, SO THEY KNOWLINGLY GAVE ME THE WRONG PAPERWORK TO FILL OUT SO THAT I COULD INCUR MORE FEES WHICH IS A VIOLATION OF CFPB LAWS. They are trying to penalize me and charge me for overdraft protection that I never requested to begin with AND filled out an application stating that I DO NOT WANT THEM TO PAY IT. They are lying and severely breaking the law. They are just trying to profit from the consumers with the lowest monies in their accounts to utilize - that money that they generate from NSF fees - to pay out to their customers with big business and big money. What they 're doing is fraud and illegal. They 're commingling funds and manipulating their currency to accumulate a substantial amount of money through NSF fees TO PROFIT. A reasonable person under the same and similar circumstances would agree with me.

I called them almost a month ago and I spoke to one of the mangers that refuse to give me her name, I told her that I had signed three years ago to be -opt -- out from checking account and finally they discovered that I did, and now it is in effect but is too late because they already charge all the money.

4751,"My husband and I have had a joint account for 20 years at the same bank. We have been loyal customers and have a checking, a savings, and a couple money market accounts. Over the years, the services have become less generous and recently I have had two very bad experiences that I do not think are legal. First, my bankcard and access to my bank account was cut off because I had not activated a new card that they had sent to me 5 months ago ( that I never received ). When I realized I could not get access to my account, I called and they said they would send me a new card in two days. I had no access to my account electronically or physically and I was unable to transfer money to cover a property tax check. My husband had to go to the bank to do it. Which brings me to the next complaint. We used to have over {$14000.00} credit as an overdraft account. As a busy household with XXXX incomes and young kids, we used this overdraft account often for credit whenever we needed the flexibility for timing of expenses. We have paid plenty of interest to the bank for this flexibility. Late last year the account was reduced to {$300.00}. This amount for us covers very little when you are talking about {$12000.00} of activity during the course of a month. We did get a letter from the bank saying that they were reducing it due to  my husband 's delinquency '' ( there were none - it is a joint account under good standing ) ;  insufficient deposit relationship '' ; and I was listed as an  unqualified co-borrower ''. None of this made sense. When I went to the bank recently, I inquired about it and they said I would have to reapply for it like any other credit source. They also said the reduction was due to a low credit score and debt to income ratio. How would they know what my debt to income ratio was? They said we could see his credit report. Why did they use just his credit report and not mine for a joint account? My credit score and earnings are much higher. We have always paid our bills on time and do not have any debt under this bank anymore. ( I suspect we are being punished for moving our debt elsewhere. ) I believe these actions have been, at worst, discriminatory and illegal ; and, at best, very bad customer service. Reducing our credit line is the same thing as raising interest rates on a credit card. It has resulted in overdraft and several fees.   ",gupta362@purdue.edu,0

I thought somehow they had pulled the money from my account not that the check was bad ) and he said that there was something wrong with the first check and he was sending a check to reimburse me. I subtracted the amount of the first check from the second check and only moved {$1800.00} dollars into XXXX XXXX assistants account XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX ) because for some reason XXXX was having trouble with that account. The reimbursement check came and I deposited that XXXX and the next day withdraw the {$4800.00} dollars and deposited it into a new account ( XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX ). He was going to send XXXX more check for a scanner for {$9700.00}. I when to the bank and deposited this check but when I got home I saw that the XXXX check had bounced as well. I when to my bank and had my bank account frozen. Now I have reported this to the XXXX Police Department ( report number XXXX ) and give them copies of all the documentation I have of this crime. In all the scam took me for {$9700.00} dollars about not counting fees.  My bank should have been able to spot a fake check and refuse to let me deposit it into my bank. That failing my bank should never have allowed me to withdrawal money before the check had cleared the bank. Also the bank should not have allowed me to withdraw enough money to make my account negative, without so much as a warning.

4759,A check was given to me for services rendered. The check posted and was cleared. 2 months later my bank informed me that the check was fake and was returned. This check was for XXXX. Check writers bank ( wells fargo ) never contacted me to ask if person who wrote check stayed at our Group Home. I have all kinds of proof that check writer and his wife both stayed with us for XX/XX/XXXX. My complaint is about the process the bank followed to arrive at their conclusion. If it is a fact that both husband and wife stayed with us then HOW DID THEY PAY FOR SERVICES rendered??? Did wells fargo ask for proof of how they paid for this service? NO they did not. Why not?  The check writer signature is the same as on our Resident Agreement Contract. But if you notice when we took him and his wife to the doctors for a XXXX he signed for both him and his wife. Both signatures are different and also different from the alleged fake check. I would like proof from wells fargo how they paid for these services. This reversal never should have occurred until these questions are asked of the merchant. EXAMPLE You take XXXX friends to florida and rent a nice beach house for a month for XXXX and then lets say 5 months later I call wells fargo and say hey wait a minute I did not write or sign that check. Wells fargo says oh ok ... ... ... ..and then BOOM ... ... ... merchant is now out the money they worked hard for. There must be something in place that will help the merchant also. My belief is that wells fargo did not follow proper steps to keep the merchant side protected. I am very happy to supply any witness or document proof to show in fact both husband and wife did in fact stay at our Group Home for XX/XX/2016. My efforts in all of this is not about just getting my money back but to also look at Banking Institution Policies and procedures that end up hurting the merchants.  Wells Fargo could very easily contact us but they choose not to.  I am surprised this type of thing is not being used by world wide scammers ... ... ... ... ..it seems like a perfect scam. Just open an account with wells fargo and then go on vacation and then 3 months later say you never wrote the check. Wells fargo will check a few signatures and then just get your money back.   ,jmccror@purdue.edu,0

She promptly pulled up the account on her computer screen and even pointed out the initial deposit on XX/XX/XXXX. Reported to me that it was open in credit status only because there were notes for pending research on fees that were supposed to be reversed over 5 years ago. She then, despite my verbal opposition and the court order in front of her, insisted that she had to close the account because I was getting divorced and should not have a joint account with my spouse and that we were no longer eligible for any applicable credits. She then assured me I would have the requested statements within 2 weeks ( records over 7 years old require the processing of a research fee-despite my physically viewing the XX/XX/XXXX Statement on XXXX XXXX 's Screen ).

Over the next month, I noticed that online transactions that I had authorized using the old debit card I had reported lost, continued to be put through my account. Some examples included online memberships, like XXXX, as well as some trial magazine subscriptions. I wondered how they were being processed, because I never updated these companies with my new debit card number.

I called the customer service of the bank to dispute this debit card transaction. The agent put me on hold to investigate, then came back on the line to tell me that there were XXXX debit cards associated with my checking account. In other words, the debit card that I had reported lost was never cancelled, and transactions that I had previously authorized on the lost card, like online memberships, etc, were still being put through my account.   The customer service agent gave me a hard time about disputing the {$90.00} transaction for the subscription to XXXX XXXX and it took nearly a week for me to get a {$90.00} credit applied to my account.

On XXXX XXXX I had just come back from a trip and had forgotten to make a deposit to my account prior to leaving. I checked my bank balance online and saw that there was {$910.00} in the account. Before the bank closed I made a deposit of {$2300.00} to the account. Later in the evening I went online to download my account to XXXX. The deposit amount was shown as received by teller and a check that I had written for {$1100.00} had not cleared, nor was it shown as pending. The next day I received an overdraft charge of {$35.00} and they claimed that the check for {$1100.00} had cleared on XXXX XXXX. Their online banking had never shown that check. When I told them that I had made that deposit on XXXX XXXX their answer was that I only get {$100.00} of that to apply until the next day. I have argued with them about that but they refuse to remove the {$35.00}.   On a different account the next day a similar situation happened. I had forgotten to deduct a check I had written. There was a check I mailed to a vendor on Sat. XXXX XXXX. On Mon. XXXX XXXX that check money was debited from my account. I was overdrawn by {$56.00} and they charged my account {$36.00} for the overdraft. I run a business and on XXXX XXXX I had XXXX deposits of {$130.00} that are processed by that bank and go into that account. On Monday XXXX XXXX that XXXX deposit appeared as pending, and they did not count that money as covering the overdraft.   Here is my concern in a nutshell. The banks can immediately debit my account for checks that I write and mail to a vendor, but checks that are accepted by me and deposited in my account are held for XXXX day and do not apply to my account. That applies to cash deposits as well. If my deposit and a check come in on the same day they count the XXXX but not the other. I understand this would happen if XXXX uses an electronic transfer and set a date for the debit to be made or use a debit card, but checks that are written by someone and ones received and deposited by that person should be handled the same way. Either these checks that are scanned should show as pending on an account the same as any other check, or deposits should be treated as immediately available if overdraw situations occur. The way they are doing it now allows banks to take your money and use it for a day with deposits, but they can immediately cash your checks and remove the money from the account without it going through a pending process. It should be XXXX way or the other to be fair.   ",john1300@purdue.edu,0

4938,"The key issue here is that netspend debit cards are marketed and sold next to giftcards in pharmacy and convenience stores, but the XXXX classes of cards have significantly different rules of use. As a result, people buy debit cards, thinking they are gift cards, and when they are given to their recipients, they are done so without the recipient agreeing to significant fee rules which start upon *purchase* of the card ( vs *activation* of the card ), at least in the case of XXXX debit cards. As a result, the card value can be greatly reduced from the original value even before initial activation.   The story : My kids received netspend debit cards from their grandparents for XXXX, each with {$75.00} on them. My parents thought they were giving the kids gift cards, not reloadable debit cards.

I pointed out to her that the Uniform Commercial Code provided that once the bank had actual knowledge the check had been presented and paid, I was legally entitled to the funds, and the bank was NOT legally holding the funds.

5099,"Through this complaint, I request that CFPB staff review the action taken by TD Bank in denying my Reg E-covered unauthorized withdrawal claim. I opened an XXXX account for my minor daughter so that she would have access to limited funds on a debit card. The card and the account were used sparingly. When my daughter attempted to make a teller cash withdrawal on XXXX XXXX, 2015, she and I were advised by bank staff that our account was overdrawn in the amount of {$1800.00}. We subsequently learned that my daughter was unaware that she had lost the debit card and that XXXX counterfeit checks were deposited to the account. Whomever perpetrated this fraud capitalized on the fact that immediate credit was provided by TD at the time of deposit. ATM withdrawals were then executed against the account over a 12 day span. Once we were aware that the card had been lost and the account compromised, we filed an unauthorized electronic transaction claim with TD. At the request of bank investigator 's, a police report was filed with the XXXX XXXX Police Department.   In explicably, TD Bank has denied our claim, citing as the basis for its decision, the fact that no additional transactions were attempted after the checks deposited were returned as counterfeits and because the transactions were consistent with our normal usage pattern. XXXX 's actions in this matter are a flagrant violation of Reg E and raise a question as to whether it 's policies in this area are in conformance with the requirements of the regulation. How many other consumers have been unfairly treated as my daughter and I have been?   I want to emphasize that the unauthorized transactions were all conducted in XXXX, NJ. My daughter and I reside in XXXX, XXXX, New York. Neither of us has ever recorded a bank transaction in XXXX, nor did we transact in the amounts and frequency noted for the fraudulent transactions. Moreover, there is no significance of the fact that unauthorized activity on the account ceased after there were no longer available funds.   Reg E requires that a financial institution have evidence that a covered transaction or transactions which form the basis of a consumer claim were not unauthorized if it is to deny the call for reimbursement. TD Bank has no such evidence and the inaccurate and absurd reasons it offers to unlawfully deny my claim is behavior that warrants an examination by the CFPB.   ",meng46@purdue.edu,1

Why in the world would I want purchases to clear on my card if there were no fund and I had to pay fees for it later, that just makes no sense and I would never agree to such a thing. They mislead people with that program. They also charged me over draft fees for 2 purchases I made on a Thursday when I had funds in my account, however TD charged me for the purchases the following Tuesday. When I complained, the customer service rep told me that TD reorders your purchases, so the highest amount gets cleared first before the lower amount. This is beyond absurd, so they basically held my purchases from thursday XXXX purchases I made when I had money in my account ) and waited till I made new purchases and reordered them. So purchases made later where processed first because the amounts were higher and XXXX proceeded to charge me for the thursday purchase the following Tuesday. This is an unfair practice, when I purchase something on my card I expect it to go through right away, not held until I make a larger purchase and reordered. This is ridiculous and is how they put their customers into Over draft so that they can collect fees. This is the worst bank ever, its one thing after the next with them and their customer service is never helpful. I 'm just sick and tired of them taking advantage of their customers. I am definitely closing my TD account as soon as I get this situation sorted out. It just is n't fair.   ",heo6@purdue.edu,1

This is the first time my account has been under, and it is entirely because of the bank. I deposited XXXX checks into my account and was waiting on a third deposit to it as well. The amounts were XXXX and XXXX. I was also expected another XXXX. I received XXXX amounts into my account the following day. One week later they debited my account XXXX without any warning! No call, no email, no letter.I called customer service and was told I would be refunded within XXXX days -- weird thing, no one could look anything about about the transaction. XXXX days passed and my account remained under XXXX. I received no correspondence either. I finally called on the XXXX day and was treated horribly by everyone I spoke with. I was transferred to at least 3 different departments and then made to feel like I had stolen their money, even though it was their error! I was told that the claim I had made had been cancelled ( again, no call, no email, nothing ). I had absolutely no idea. I have spoken to everyone from the manager of the branch in which the error occured to the Customer Service Supervisor, to the research department, to the claims department. No one could tell me what happened, nor why my money has suddenly disappeared. I viewed the transaction online once discovering the overdraft and not only is the XXXX check not even on my account information, but it shows one check only XXXX. I tried to view the details of the transaction and it said it was unable to process the request and that I would have to request to have the details mailed to me, yes it costs money. I finally spoke to corporate who told me simply, it had been an error and the money does n't exist. My question is, if the money does not exist, then why am I having to physically come up with money to put in my account to zero it out? This whole thing feels like a scam to me. I would not have even known the account was under if I had not checked ( luckily ) and then would have been incurring overdraft fees! The worst part is, I have to transfer the utilities of my household to my name before the 1st of the month and now my account is negative almost {$200.00}! I do not know what happened with the bank, but they need to get their act together. This is unacceptable, and the way I was treated afterwards was absolutely shocking. I understand errors get made ; but if this was the case then why was I not contacted and why did it take a week for them to debit the account? I have a second chance account so not only am I inconvenienced by having to go into the bank to deposit my checks and cash, but a check deposit is also held if it is over {$200.00}. This deposit was not held, leaving me to believe that the money had come from two separate sources. I would like my account closed, I do not appreciate the treatment or service I have received from this bank on any level. Even the XXXX people I spoke with in the corporate office laughed at me when I told them the problem. They also said they would not be refunding my money and that I will just have to accept it.

The folks doing this were alleged  loan officers '' from whatever name they used. I was not happy. Called the bank first to have these transactions reversed immediately.

For some unknown reason they stopped asking what my password was. I had noted that when I called because the person answering the call did not ask me, nor the next person.

I was told that I would have to go to a branch and speak to a manager.

I further explained that I only opened the bank account to get favorable loan terms and had no reason to further engage the account as it was a secondary account that had no activity since its inception ( other than the fees ). I did n't receive any statements because I opted out of postal mailings and I never established an online view because I was told there was no fees and I had no activity on the account.

This user later contacted paypal making a claim that their identity was stolen and the transactions were unauthorized. However after submitting ID information and IP information for review by paypal their specialists determined that the claim was in fact false and all of the transactions were authorized. At this point the money was returned to my account. A week later paypal then claimed that all of these transactions were reversed through ACH reversals made through her bank. The reversals were in total almost {$12000.00}. They then requested that I pay for the entire amount. They placed my account on hold, taking all of my funds and preventing me from continuing any of my business transactions. This effectively removed me from having a job and I was given no opportunity to respond to this new set of reversals.   I requested the names of the banks that the reversals were made from but they refused to provide me with the bank information and refused any information I offered for the case. This left me with no way of combating the disputes with paypal and absolutely no evidence that the bank reversal claims were even true. Paypal said that I was not eligible for protection because XXXX are an intangible good.

In addition to this, all of the sales were completed using the XXXX website which provides tracking and proof of delivery for all online sales. However paypal rejected this information.   Paypal did not even attempt to fight this fraud or give me the opportunity to fight it myself despite the compounding evidence against this other user. I believe that at the very least I should be provided with the reversal documents as proof that they were even made. Hiding the personal information of the user who made the reversal would be acceptable but providing no proof at all is not.

5236,"Dear Sir, MadamThursdays are one of my days off. It is also the days I get paid, late in the day to the wee hours of Friday from one of my jobs. Both of my paychecks have always deposited with JP Morgan. Last Thursday being almost virtually with no money but compelled to do my grocery shopping considering the fact that I will be back at my 14 hours a day schedule for the next three days ( Fridays, Saturdays and Sundays ), with no time to do those chores, I waited well into the afternoon and ran these errands. When I do this, JP Morgan Chase will substract the amount of my groceries shopping from the pay checks that were being deposited by my employers. Or this bank could decide to charge me. There is no clear rule as to why it has this option because JP Morgan Chase is the only party that is in the position to say when my checks were deposited and decide to charge penalties or not to charge penalties. And it did charge penalties, three times, last Thursday going into Friday. And it charged me penalties many times due to this fact that the bank is the only one to say whether or not deposits were made before the cut off time : penalties for overdraft on annuities, penalties on tax returns until the IRS issued specific recommendations. So, I believe the latest penalties JP Morgan charged me again are abusive and would like it to refund me those.

I have sent several messages informing them of their offer terms as advertised by them, and they still refuse to make good on the terms of the offer. Instead, they tell me to go to a branch, where I am certain I will be told there is nothing they can do. This is the exact text of the offer advertised : '' * Offer valid in select markets only ; including XXXX XXXX, MO, XXXX, TN, and XXXX, NC. {$200.00} bonus offer may not be combined with any other offer, does not apply if you already have a Regions checking account, only applies to personal XXXX checking accounts, and may be withdrawn at any time. To earn this bonus, you must meet all requirements of the offer described above within 60 days of opening your new account. If earned, the bonus will be issued within 120 days of meeting these requirements, and will be in the form of a credit to the new checking account, which must be open at the time the credit is issued. All XXXX checking accounts require a {$50.00} minimum opening deposit. The Annual Percentage Yield ( APY ) paid on LifeGreen Preferred Checking accounts is determined by account balance and, as of XX/XX/XXXX, was 0.01 % for all balances. Regions may change the APY at any time. Fees may reduce earnings on XXXX Preferred Checking accounts. No interest is paid on other XXXX checking accounts. A monthly fee may apply to your XXXX checking account, depending on account type, but this fee may be waived on some accounts if certain conditions are met. For accounts opened in Iowa, certain account fees are subject to Iowa State Tax of 6 %, which will be assessed at the time the fee is charged, unless exempt. Taxes are the responsibility of the recipient.  I am a resident of XXXX XXXX, MO, and was not currently a Regions customer before opening my checking account. I qualify for the offer. If Regions wanted to exclude those who have EVER had an account with them, that should have been stated in the offer terms.   ",dcherian@purdue.edu,0
5239,"In late 2014, I removed overdraft protection services from a Wells Fargo checking account. I did so while going through tough financial times to avoid the large and onerous {$35.00} overdraft fees. Through my Wells Fargo debit card, I have multiple automatically re-occurring payments set up for services like XXXX, XXXX and XXXX streaming video services. In the past when my account balance has been insufficient to cover those transactions, they 've been denied by the bank as expected. I can point to specific instances on XXXX XXXX and XXXX where this occurred. Last month, on XXXX XXXX, a payment was submitted by XXXX for {$8.00} when my account balance was a negative balance of approximately {$240.00}. As expected, the payment was declined. On XXXX XXXX and XXXX, I made deposits to my account totalling {$220.00} to bring my account balance to about negative {$20.00}. On XXXX XXXX and XXXX, XXXX reoccurring payment were submitted for which my account balance was not sufficient. Contrary to my expectations, these payments were authorized and I was charged for XXXX seperate {$35.00} overdraft fees, a total of {$100.00}. In contacting Wells Fargo today, they were unable to provide any explanation of why these payments were authorized and overdraft fees were charged, contrary to what has occurred on my account in the past. The only suggestion they could provide was that perhaps the merchant/vendor had done something different with the payments. To that end, I contacted the customer service of a specific merchant ( XXXX ) to check to see the payment they submitted on XXXX XXXX differed in any way from previously pre-authorized payments. Per their customer service, it did not. I was also advised that XXXX submitted another pre-authorized payment attempt on XXXX XXXX which was also declined by Wells Fargo. So far in contacting Wells Fargo, I have been unable to determine either why payments in the past they claim should have been authorized were not, nor why payments these payments were authorized, despite of payments for the same amounts from the same vendors in the past being declined. I suspect, though can not confirm, that there exists some rule within Wells Fargo ( perhaps unknown to their customer service representatives ) that overdraft transactions are somehow authorized or declined based off of account balances.

5241,"I obtained a Visa credit card from Navy Federal Credit Union XX/XX/XXXX over the phone and I was offered the credit protection plan that protects me from involuntary loss of employment, death and XXXX. I was employed the entire time on this program as a full time employer until XXXX XXXX, XXXX. I opened my initial claim in XXXX of XXXX and took a temporary assignment in XXXX XXXX and worked the assignment until XXXX XXXX, XXXX. I called Navy Federal to report another claim that I was not working on XXXX XXXX, XXXX and was told two weeks later that I did not qualify for the benefits due to my temporary work status and they did not cover temporary employment. I then explained that I lost my permanent job back in XXXX of XXXX, and that a claim had been submitted to use the benefits. I was told that they would open the initial claim I submitted in XX/XX/XXXX. I next received a call stating that I again was not qualified due to I needed to be unemployed for 30 days. I was told I should not have taken the temporary assignment in order to be qualified. I advised them at no time was I ever told that accepting temporary employment would disqualify me from using the benefits of the service. I was informed that It was in my disclosure and I explained to them that I was offered the service over the phone and never received any disclosure or had any program limits explained to me over the phone. I never was asked my status of employment when I was offered the service and was told that the benefit of the service was for coverage if I ever loss my full time job, death, or XXXX. At no time was I told accepting a temporary assignment that it would disqualify me to receive the benefit of the program. At that point I requested a copy of any written disclosure that may have been sent in XX/XX/XXXX as I never received one. I have not been given any disclosures regarding the program after multiple request. The company has not to date presented any documentation dating back to the time that I accepted the program for me to review or showing written acknowledgement of my consent. Additionally, I took a loan in XXXX XXXX and was offered the same program again by phone and was not asked my employment status. So it seems to me that this is a predatory practice by the credit union to have folks join by phone without offering any disclosures about program limitations. The bait and switch practice is to have unsuspecting customers pay for the program and when unfortunate circumstances arise and the program is needed it is only then that the company comes up with  disclosure '' reasons not to provide the coverage or provide the benefits paid for. In my case, I have paid for benefits since XX/XX/XXXX until XXXX and never have received the benefit of the service when needed in XX/XX/XXXX/XX/XX/XXXX. I have never paid my Visa bill late, have a stellar credit rating and now as results of Navy Federal 's unfair predatory practice I am facing a late payment history, potential negative impact on my credit and possible interest rate increases. Since XX/XX/XXXX, I have in good faith maintained this program to avoid having this type of situation occur. Navy Federal needs to be accountable and honor the goal of the program as it was sold to me instead of compounding an already difficult situation. The company 's attempt to refund fees for the service is insulting and a shameful attempt to exploit the desperation of my situation and a cheap alternative to not honor its obligation. It does nothing to resolve the situation for which I had already paid to ensure that if the circumstances ever arose, my exposure would be minimized.   ",hughe146@purdue.edu,0

When the items arrived to our customers location we noticed they were all broken and could not be installed. We immediately contacted the vendor and provided them with videos and pictures of the damaged goods. The vendor at not point in time tried to correct the problem or issue us a refund.

XXXX however did come to the site were the glass was delivered and confirmed that glass was indeed broken and could not be used. At that point in time XXXX decided to pay out the claim directly to XXXX XXXX. Unfortunately XXXX XXXX insured their package incorrectly as you will see in the emails attached. They were supposed to have insured the package for {$25.00} per pound but only did {$2.00} This only allowed XXXX to payout {$2.00} for the claim which is clearly not enough to cover our damages. All this information was passed on to our bank CHASE/VISA. They stated to us that they would open a claim and try and collect the funds back for us. A couple of months into the dispute process were contacted by CHASE and informed that we had won the arbitration and that the temporary credit would not be permanent. Fast forward a month or so later and CHASE has now taken the money out of our account. Now all of a sudden they 're telling us that we lost the claim in arbitration and that they provided us the incorrect information.

5315,"On XXXX XXXX, 2015, an elderly customer went into a local branch of Wells Fargo in XXXX, PA and asked the teller to transfer {$6000.00} from a savings account into a checking account. The teller, in error, transferred the money from the checking into a savings account. This action caused the checking account to be negative. On XXXX XXXX, the customer attempted to withdraw money via an ATM and was not able to because of the negative checking account balance. The customer went into the branch for assistance and that is when the teller error was discovered. The branch reversed what they did and that brought the account into the positive. The branch manager apologized for the error, assured the customer that fees had been reversed and the customer leaves. Later that same week, the customer attempts to take money out from an ATM and again, there was no funds available. The customer goes into the branch again to see the branch manager. The branch manager advised the customer that this issue was his fault. It was the customer 's responsibility to monitor his account on line and that it was his own fault that the transfer was done backwards and that had he reviewed his account on line, this would never have occurred. Then the branch manager lectured the customer to the benefits of paying bills on line. The reason the customer was not able to withdraw funds the XXXX time was due to the branch reversing their error, but never actually doing the original transfer. Upon reconciling the checking account, the customer discovered the transfer had not taken place and the funds were moved at that point. It was also found that not all of the fees incurred were not reversed entirely, but only partially.   ",pearson9@purdue.edu,0

5393,"On XXXX XXXX 2015 ( Monday, XXXX/XXXX/15 ), I was the victim of an identity theft on my personal checking account from Regions Bank. My account was defrauded {$500.00}. Additionally, as the ATM used for the fraudulent transaction was operated by XXXX, my account was deducted {$4.00} in ATM usage fees from XXXX, {$2.00} in ATM usage fees from Regions, and {$2.00} in account balance verification fees from Regions. Altogether, my personal checking account from Regions was defrauded {$500.00}. Upon discovering that I was the victim of an identity theft, I immediately contacted Regions Bank and informed them of the fraud. I explained to Regions that my debit card was in my possession the entire time, was never stolen/missing, and was never given to any other individual for use. Whether by skimming or another card hacking device or technique, my card and pin were compromised and used at a local ATM for theft. I was instructed by Regions to destroy the current debit card in my possession as that card would be cancelled in the Regions system. Per Regions Bank, a new card would be sent to me and the fraudulent transactions would be flagged and investigated. I was instructed to stop by at a local Regions Bank branch to sign the requisite forms, including affidavits, verifying that the withdrawal was indeed a fraudulent transaction. As this happened on XXXX XXXX, the banks were closed. The very next morning ( Tuesday, XXXX/XXXX/15 ), I stopped by the XXXX branch in XXXX, LA to complete the forms. I checked in with Regions Bank on Friday morning, XXXX/XXXX/15 to inquire about the pending investigation. I was told that my claim was denied for a return of the stolen funds as this was an ATM withdrawal and, per Regions, the only way money could be withdrawn was with the use of my card and my pin. Additionally, as I was  in the area '' ( XXXX XXXX is not that big of a city ), my claim was denied. A notice would be mailed to me and arrive shortly explaining their denial of the claim. Their  investigation '' took less than 2 business days. I asked them to take a look at the ATM video footage of the withdrawal in question in order to verify the identity of the actual person who committed the crime. Per Regions, as this happened at a XXXX location, they can not review ATM footage unless the local police department conducts an investigation and receives the video footage ; to then hand over to Regions Bank. It was at that moment, days later, that the bank advised me to contact a police department and file a police report. Currently, this matter is being investigated by XXXX as the crime happened in XXXX XXXX, LA. I 'm filing this complaint for several reasons:1. Regions Bank advised me to contact the local police AFTER their investigation and claim denial. If a police report is a vital part of a bank 's fraud investigation, then the consumer and identity theft victim should be advised upon reporting a fraud.  2. Regions is apparently not up to date on current fraud techniques and, as such, can not provide adequate consumer protection.  3. I do not do business with XXXX. If Regions and XXXX allow account holders to access funds using each others ATMs, they should be able to exchange information regarding cases of fraud or other financial crimes.  4. Throughout the claim process, I was treated like the perpetrator, not the victim. I was told by several Regions associates ( names withheld ) that as the withdrawal was at an ATM, the individual accessing the funds had to have been me. I was told that as I was  in the area '', the fraud was most likely committed by me. The only way that I, the victim, can expect any level of consumer protection and restitution is to do the legwork of the bank : Providing data, contacting XXXX to request a release of the video footage to the police, and acting as an intermediary between the banks.

5403,"We live in NY State. We were flooded by Hurricane XXXX and XXXX. Flood Insurance Money that came to us was withheld by HSBC Bank until we did repairs. It was about {$12000.00}. We believe some interest was paid on that amount to our account. Shortly thereafter, another {$40000.00} was given to us from Hurricane XXXX, and the Bank also withheld that money pending repairs to our home. On XXXX XXXX, 2013, HSBC transferred their Mortgage Services to XXXX XXXX XXXX. They are holding appx {$52000.00} Flood Insurance Money in their Bank pending our signing a reconstruction contract with a builder, which has not yet occurred. When our {$52000.00} was transferred to XXXX, there were no written receipt sent to us attesting to the fact that they had that money in our account. I made numerous phone calls to XXXX XXXX, asking for something in writing to prove that our money, in that amount, was being held by them. After all, if their computers went down, how could we prove that they had our {$52000.00}. If I put XXXX cents into a savings account, I get a receipt. XXXX XXXX absolutely refused to provide us with a receipt on paper attesting to the fact that they were holding {$52000.00} of our money.  Also, they refused to say if they were paying us interest on that money. Apparently, there IS NO law in NY State requiring Banks to pay interest on Flood Insurance Money being held by Banks. WHY, I DO NOT KNOW. I AM SURE THE BANK IS MAKING MONEY ON OUR {$52000.00}. Any money they make on Our money is ours. I am sure they are investing that money, and keeping it.   I wrote recently to the New York State Department of Financial Services about these XXXX issues. They forwarded a complaint to XXXX XXXX. I received a letter from XXXX XXXX supposedly in answer to my complaint. They did put in writing, in that letter, that they were holding {$52000.00} of our Flood Insurance Money. So finally, the State Agency got that in writing for us after two years. However, XXXX XXXX stonewalled on the issue of interest due us on that money. They filled half of the letter with an answer to an issue that I did not raise, and that was the issue of them releasing our Flood Insurance Money to us. I did not ask them to release any funds yet. They made it appear that they were answering my complaint, but they answered a question that they made up, not my real question.  Finally, they did not address the issue of whether we were due interest, and if not, why. They stated this :  Additionally, we recognize XXXX XXXX 's and XXXX XXXX 's concerns over the interest earned on the escrow funds. With the final disbursement of the insurance funds, any interest earned will be released with the draw.  We realize that no interest has been paid on these escrow funds, because the bank would have issued us a XXXX form.  We believe this is not fair. There may be as many as XXXX homeowners in New York State with banks holding Flood Insurance funds. They are, we feel strongly, profiting from all of these funds which are not theirs. Why are the Banks allowed to cheat us in this way?   ",tdeters@purdue.edu,0

5531,"This is a growing problem with electronic bill payment through banks and credit card companies. In the past, the representation was/is that an electronic payment started on a particular day would reach and be credited by the payee the next day. The electronic process is quick ; that it might take a day arises from the fact that payer must send, then payee must examine the  package '', i.e. XXXX separate electronic processes : sending is completed the day of sending, examination of package by payee is done the same day or the next day. Thus, sending should be complete on the day of payment, crediting should be done either that same day if payee is entitled to use the funds that day or by the next day if entitled to use them the next day. There is no reason for further delay, and banks accepting electronic payments must do so promptly. Recently, I have been charged late fees and interest by Bank of America and XXXX credit cards when evidence likely shows the sending was electronically done well before the due date, i.e. these credit card companies insist on crediting the day after so their computers can charge hefty late fees and interest. Meanwhile, the sending bank ( XXXX bill payment ) is now changing, without warning, its description of electronic bill payment to the effect that electronic payment will take 2 business days beyond the day of sending ( i.e. not counting the day of electronic sending ). This is not only unreasonable but collusion with other banks delaying crediting to charge late fees and interest. It is unreasonable because : Question  gt ; What is the sending bank doing on the day of sending electronically [ Note, these are recurring monthly payments, so the bank knows weeks in advance when to start ] if not sending an electronic package which arrives somewhere the same day? It should not take 2 extra business days for the receiving bank to examine the electronic package electronically. The one extra day allowed in the past is more than enough, and receiving banks should credit payment either the day of actual electronic receipt or actual availability of electronic funds which is the same day anyway [ just like a check is supposed to have sufficient funds when issued, an electronic payment should have sufficient funds also ]. The problems arose with electronic payments scheduled for a Friday with a credit card due date of Monday, with receiving bank ( Bank of America and XXXX credit cards ) crediting payment and charging late fee and interest on Tuesday. When informed of this development, XXXX now changes its representation that it would not be liable until 2 business days after, i.e. not counting the day of sending, this is collusion with the receiving banks. An electronic transaction started on Friday should not take til Tuesday. A receiving bank knows THE SUM TOTAL of the package on Friday and can use those funds on Friday even before it distributes fund into each separate account. There is no reason why it should not credit the separate accounts by Monday, even retroactively if necessary. Whereas XXXX was previously willing to inform the receiving banks that the electronic payment was started on Friday, now it says it has no duty to help for any due date until ( i.e. falling before ) Wednesday.

You ( someone at Ally XXXX said there was no way to opt out of this and also no way to avoid a fee if using the debit card were to overdraft the account. Are you sure about this?

Overdraft protection is a service offered by banks that allows checking account holders to temporarily make purchases with a debit card even if they do n't have sufficient funds in their account to cover them. In effect, the bank makes a shortterm loan to the account holder so his debit card is n't declined at the register or an ATM machine. In return, the bank charges an overdraft fee of {$10.00} to {$35.00}, according to an informal XXXX survey.

I called the number on the letter on XXXX XXXX, only to have a rude lady tell me it was a Business decision, but no reason as to why. After returning for another trip, I went into my XXXX XXXX Georgia branch on XXXX XXXX and asked the manager about the letter, he called the number on the letter and got the same response. I then spoke to his boss who suggested that the manager e-mail the regulatory division of the bank and that they would contact me in XXXX hours. No one called, I went back to the bank on XXXX XXXX to close my accounts and he said he 'd e-mail them again. I asked for his bosses boss name and got XXXX and his number. Called XXXX XXXX on XXXX XXXX and he said he 'd get to the bottom of it and get back to me that afternoon. He never called back so the following Monday XXXX XXXX, I called him, got his voice mail and left another message. Finally, a call came Monday afternoon XXXX XXXX from ( XXXX ) XXXX XXXX assistant telling me to call the number on the letter, I explained to her that I and the branch manager had already called to no avail. She said XXXX XXXX would call me back. He did n't. I then on Tuesday XXXX XXXX, e-mail XXXX, his boss XXXX XXXX and her boss XXXX XXXX . Hoping someone could tell me why Sunrust had requested me to close my accounts. I recieved a voicemail from XXXX the assiatant telling me to call the number on the letter, that they could only talk to me. So on Wednesday I called the number again and got the same response,  Business Decision ''. Nothing from XXXX 's boss, XXXX XXXX or her boss XXXX XXXX. I would just like to know WHY i was asked to close my account after 30 years of being a loyal customer. And to be reimbursed for new checks that I bought a month prior and pro-rate the fee I paid for the debit card.  Many Thanks   ",bkoehler25@gmail.com,0

5698,"This is a growing problem with electronic bill payment through banks and credit cardcompanies. In the past, the representation was/is that an electronic payment started on a particular day would reach and be credited by the payee the next day. The electronic process is quick ; that it might take a day arises from the fact that payer must send, then payee must examine the  package '', i.e. XXXX separate electronic processes : sending is completed the day of sending, examination of package by payee is done the same day or the next day. Thus, sending should be complete on the day of payment, crediting should be done either that same day if payee is entitled to use the funds that day or by the next day if entitled to use them the next day. There is no reason for further delay, and banks accepting electronic payments must do so promptly. Recently, I have been charged latefees and interest by XXXX XXXX XXXX and XXXX credit cards when evidence likely shows the sending was electronically done well before the due date, i.e. these credit card companies insist on crediting the day after so their computers can charge hefty late fees and interest. Meanwhile, the sending bank ( Citibank bill payment ) is now changing, without warning, its description of electronic bill payment to the effect that electronic payment will take 2 business days beyond the day of sending ( i.e. not counting the day of electronic sending ). This is not only unreasonable but collusion with other banks delaying crediting to charge late fees and interest. It is unreasonable because : Question  gt ; What is the sending bank doing on the day of sending electronically [ Note, these are recurringmonthly payments, so the bank knows weeks in advance when to start ] if not sending an electronic package which arrives somewhere the same day? It should not take 2 extra business days for the receiving bank to examine the electronic package electronically. The one extra day allowed in the past is more than enough, and receiving banks should credit payment either the day of actual electronic receipt or actual availability of electronic funds which is the same day anyway [ just like a check is supposed to have sufficient funds when issued, an electronic payment should have sufficient funds also ]. The problems arose with electronic payments scheduled for a Friday with a credit carddue date of Monday, with receiving bank ( XXXX XXXX XXXX and XXXX credit cards ) crediting payment and charging late fee and interest on Tuesday. When informed of this development, Citibank now changes its representation that it would not be liable until 2 business days after, i.e. not counting the day of sending, this is collusion with the receiving banks. An electronic transaction started on Friday should not take til Tuesday. A receiving bank knows THE SUM TOTAL of the package on Friday and can use those funds on Friday even before it distributes fund into each separate account. There is no reason why it should not credit the separate accounts by Monday, even retroactively if necessary. Whereas Citibank was previously willing to inform the receiving banks that the electronic payment was started on Friday, now it says it has no duty to help for any due date until ( i.e. falling before ) Wednesday.

I was working in XX/XX/XXXX and have not worked for the past three months. I ran into problems when my Washington State Unemployment ran out and I had to apply from XXXX. They made me wait three weeks for my {$270.00}. I ran into issues with Wells Fargo and overdraft fees when I discovered they would process payments ( ie from Pay Pal ) usually recurring payments when I did not have money in my account. I asked them several times to not pay out money I do n't have and do n't charge me for overdraft fees. They ignored me. Then I would argue with them. Then Wells Fargo decided they were not going to refund any more overdraft charges. Currently I am overdrawn with Wells Fargo for {$500.00} of which almost the entire amount is overdraft fees of {$35.00}. My initial arguement with them started when I asked them to make sure my water bill got paid, and what do you know they did n't pay the amount out and then I got hit with {$35.00} of overdraft fees plus {$30.00} from the water and sewer department. All without a single human hand touching the transaction. I have called Wells Fargo several times until I just lost it and told them XXXX themselves. Now I am on a permanent blacklist.

5723,"This complaint is about the fees my bank charged for a wire transfer, not the transfer itself. I did some business with a company XXXX and they pay through wire transfer. I had the money wired to my SunTrust account. The remitting bank XXXX provided a receipt showing that they remitted {$9100.00} XXXX to SunTrust. When I received the deposit, {$30.00} XXXX was missing, but then SunTrust charged me {$15.00} separately for a  domestic '' wire transfer. SunTrust publishes an incoming international wire transfer fee of {$30.00}. When I questioned the double charge XXXX {$30.00} off the top and {$15.00} extra ), SunTrust said they did not charge the {$30.00}. After several emails and phone calls, someone looked at the trail and determined that the incoming wire transfer came through XXXX bank and SunTrust received {$9100.00}. My guess is that SunTrust uses XXXX to process their international wire transfers since they are not an international bank. The Swift code for SunTrust was used but it obviously went through XXXX first, which shaved the published {$30.00} fee off the transaction.

Issue TWO : more lies after lying to get me to open the account with them my card BRAND NEW CARD was compromised and I had to file a claim no big deal I have overdraft and they promise hey your car payment will go through if its attempted since we have a fraud investigation going through and any overdraft fee will be waived. Long long story short my account was closed and I now  owe '' them XXXX ALL OF WHICH is in overdraft fees that they promised would never happen I know they wont acually respond to the complaint with more than a dunned email and a deposit agreement. The verbal contract *recognized by law in arkansas with a witness lucky me i was on speakerphone at my desk and a co-worker overheard it* to waive ALLLLLLL fees related to the fraudulent activity and the promise that my car payment would go through was not kept that being just as valid as the deposit agreement invalidates the dunned response but U.S. Bank doesnt care as long as they get to do what they want they continually walk all over the consumer.

5764,"Wells Fargo Bank closed my IRA CD in error and sent a check for the balance to another financial institution without my knowledge or written approval. This is the account that I had arranged to draw my required minimum distribution. When I discovered this error, I went to the local branch of Wells Fargo and asked the bank to place a stop payment on the check and reopen the IRA account they closed in error. They refused to place a stop payment, but stated they would request the return of the funds and treat it as a rollover, not a correction of the Bank error.  When the check arrived at the other financial institution, they processed it to my IRA account with them as a direct transfer. At this point I decided it was in my best interest to leave the funds at the new institution.  Even though the amount of the lost interest is minimal, Wells Fargo never offered to reimburse me for this loss.  I have since requested a letter from Wells Fargo acknowledging their error for my records in the event of an IRS issue. To date, I have heard nothing from Wells Fargo.   ",han288@purdue.edu,1

A day later ( unbeknownst to me ) Huntington reversed the refund off my account. This caused other OD fees when I used my debit card. Huntington now says the charges are my fault when my statement ( screenshot attached ) clearly shows the errors.   ",ye97@purdue.edu,1

5837,"I got a message on my phone that someone was added as a wire transfer recipient. I tried to log into my account, but the password had been changed. I was able to sign in with my phone using touch access. I saw that there was someone added as a recipient and money had been wired out of the account. I called the bank and asked them to cancel the transfer. While on the phone with the representative XXXX more transfers came through. The representative had asked if I had called in earlier in the day, because they showed that someone had called in. Someone had stolen my account information and was accessing my account. Even though I called right after and during the time the transfers were posted the bank was not able to stop the transfers and I had to file a claim. Throughout the process I was told that it could take up to 10 days for there to be a resolution and the money returned to me. My claim was filed on XXXX and as of today XXXX the money still has not been returned to me. I have called the bank multiple times and been transferred around every time even though I follow the instructions on what options to push.

5843,First I was not properly explained during my account opening the opt in or opt out procedure of overdrafts and they did n't go over any of the additional steps that I needed to take to ensure my protection against overdraft fees. I had the money available in my savings account but the personal banker had not linked my accounts together like I assumed she had when she talked about it. She explained the opt in as overdraft protection instead of what it really was. She also did not give me a temporary card when opening my account so I had no access to my money until I came back from vacation even though she knew I would need it. She did not go over the steps needed for online banking and I was not able to make the changes to protect myself against fees such as linking accounts and setting up alerts which I thought she had already done for me since it was something that was discussed.   After I had noticed that I had over {$200.00} in fees in less than 2 days I went to a branch near my work but they could n't do anything since they did n't have an approval from anyone. The manager at the XXXX branch attempted to get approval but there was neither a manager or assistant manager to help and they told me I had to go in the next day when they would be available. When I went in to the branch that opened my account I was not able to speak with the manager because he was in a meeting. I asked if I could come back later and the assistant made a point that he would not help me and that it would be useless for me to call him at a later time. I then tried to get information about the call center and whether they would be able to help but she told me there was no point and that if she would n't help me no one else would be able to do anything either and I just had to take the fees. She was extremely rude the entire time and from what I understand from her customers and employees she is like this with everyone and also treats her employees poorly to where they no longer wish to work there just because of her just as I no longer wish to bank there anymore.

I would have understood if BECU honored the transaction by giving me an overdraft and then charging me a fee, but they did not. I have had an account with BECU for a while, and I have never had a failed transaction. BECU prides itself as a CREDIT UNION, and it proudly advertises itself as more caring and friendly to its  members '' not  customers '' as the big banks call us. I suppose the word  members '' to BECU means the same as the word  customers '' to the big banks ; it 's just a matter of semantics ; the word  members '' sounds friendly in need and not in deed, because the bottom line is the same :  we, your friendly credit union, will not give you, members, a first time warning, but PUNISH you with an unreasonable fee even if you make a transaction that does not go through, and even if we ( BECU ) do not incur any loss of funds on our side, and that is the rule and that is how we treat our MEMBERS.

5849,"I am a Chase customer. I was very disappointed with Chase ' services twice. First was when I set up a payment on an auto insurance company ( XXXX ) on a specific date in which I am 100 % sure I will get enough funds on that day because it 's payday. When XXXX attempted to push thru the payment, the bank denied the payment. XXXX tried twice to get the payment but was denied by Chase, twice. I spoke to several Chase bank specialists and they were all saying that there are no trace of XXXX payment placed on that day. On the other hand, XXXX was claiming they attempted to get the payment twice on that day but was declined by Chase. I was caught in between and Chase did not help me resolve this issue, I ended up paying DMV a lapse of my insurance due to XXXX canceling my auto insurance. XXXX cancelled my insurance because Chase did not provide any proof that I have enough funds in that account. Although my bank statement shows that I did have the funds, but XXXX is not accepting it because they needed a letter head from Chase stating that it was a Bank error. Chase refused to help me with that. I was left unanswered with my confusion that time. A month later, I also have a tuition fee with a huge amount scheduled. I knew I did not have enough funds on the scheduled date and I did not have any opportunity to cancel the scheduled auto-payment since it was done online ( and no options were shown ). I was expecting that Chase would deny that payment since I did not have enough funds in bank, like what happened to the XXXX incident last month. To my surprise, my bank was overdrawn. The payment went thru. I did not understand what 's going on. I called chase again and they can not give me any answers. I had to undergo so many hassle just because of the same situation but with different solutions. Although Chase helped me to stop the payment made, they did not even apologize for this inconvenience. The second frustration i have for Chase was when they closed my account without giving me prior notice. They did not call nor email me with this matter. Today is Monday and also my payday, so I went to go shop for XXXX presents and was embarrassed by the counter upon paying because my debit card was declined. Ofcourse, I double checked my funds and I have {$400.00} available balance to spend. I called chase again and they were saying that my account was closed and they can not undo it because they needed my SSN verification. I opened my account about 5 years ago and they did not require my SSN. It 's very upsetting to return the gifts I was supposed to purchase because I was not informed about closed my checking account. When I spoke to the specialist, she was sarcastic and rude, as if she was annoyed by my inquiries. I totally did not understand why they have to close my account for that reason and without a notice. They said they mailed a notice but I did not receive any. And also, if my account was closed, why did my cheque was deposited to my account and why the teller in the Chase branch did not inform me about my closed account? My Chase mobile app is showing that my account is still active and I can still view my account activities and balance. There are no signs or ways that I can tell that my bank account was closed until I swiped my card. Imagine when I was at a restaurant and I had to pay the food I just ate. This is not fair. My complaint for chase is that they are not consistent and they are misleading their clients. They do not give proper information and notice. They do not provide good costumer services and they do not think of what the customer will feel or will go through because of their mistakes. I am not a happy camper here. This should not be happening.   ",lin551@purdue.edu,0

I personally went to the Bank of America in XXXX, Texas XXXX ( XXXX XXXX XXXX # XXXX ) to ask what the status of the account was since my parents passed away. I was told since my name was on the account I could do whatever I wanted with the account and they would remove my parents names. I mailed copies of both death certificates to BOA as requested and then BOA sent me a new signature card to sign so only my name would be on the account, which they now have. In the meantime I was paying any bills that needed paying for my parents. During that XXXX month period I personally deposited {$1000.00} of my own money and my brother deposited {$5000.00} to the account to make sure there was money to cover any medical bills. I was told I was in control of this account or I would have handled the final expenses and deposits differently. Two months later on XXXX/XXXX/XXXX I see that there is a hold on the account of {$1200.00} and {$2200.00} - I called on XXXX/XXXX/XXXX and was told they were holding 50 % of the account for my Mom and 25 % for my date to cover any interest paid by the bank ( total interest paid in XXXX was {$0.00} ) so this makes no since to hold {$3500.00} for interest paid by the bank. I was also told on this call that the account was not set up with Right of Survivorship which up to this point I had not been told in person or on the phone. Also they have now tied my hands to pay any unforeseen bills that come in. All of my parents other assets were controlled by their trust but because we had the understanding that this account was under my control there was no need to include this account in the trust or probate their will. We were utilizing this account for end of life expenses. BOA is telling me the only option I have to get this money released is to Probate their will just for this checking account. BOA for two months gave me incorrect information in the Bank and on the phone because I also called and verified if I needed to do anything with this account or did I have control of it and was told YES. The bank should allow any surviving accountholder to continue to use the account to transact business after the death of another accountholder. We have an executed will and an executed trust that defines all asset distributions for my parents estate that should be sufficient to release these funds. I took all the right steps to notify BOA and now am being penalized because of BOA 's misinformation. It 's obvious if they sent me an new signature card ( in the mail ) they acknowledged I was entitled to control the account which confirms what I was told by BOA in person in the Bank in XXXX and on the phone. I have a copy of the original signature card from  NationsBank '' from XXXX ( 20 years ago ) where the Accounts Names and Signature box for me to sign were prefilled by the bank. We had no idea we needed to mark any other boxes than what was prefilled by NationsBank ( now BOA ) 20 years ago. Current BOA forms make you initial that your are denying the Right of Survivorship.

They explained that at XXXX each day, the deposits made before XXXX are added to the account, then any transactions that are posted ( collected by the merchant ) before XXXX are subtracted from the balance and then any transactions that are pending which would be overdrafts are assessed the fee. When I asked them to explain to me specifically how each of my transactions incurred a fee, the customer service team lead named XXXX said  Ok, let me give you an example.

Additionally, TCF customer service was unable to describe for me how exactly each transaction incurred an overdraft fee. Furthermore, my call was disconnected twice conveniently when it seemed they could not explain something important, like how they get away with charging me a fee when they have not even received a demand for payment from the merchant and why two weeks ago they held my transactions in a pending state for days without charging a fee and only charged a fee after they conveniently posted several transactions on the same day as another transaction came through that would cause all transactions to overdraw, but not those same type transactions incur a fee within hours of authorization.

5934,"I regularly use Chase Bank 's ATM and Branch deposit services but today I decided to try out their Chase Mobile phone app to deposit a check. With all three services the wording is nearly identical on any disclaimers. Essentially  deposit by the cutoff time and your deposit will be processed that day. Funds will be made available within 24 hours. Any holds placed on the account can affect funds availability. '' With both ATM and XXXX deposits, courtesy funds are made available to the account until the checking funds come through. This is not mentioned anywhere on the deposit slips but has happened every time I have ever deposited via ATM or Branch over the course of several years. There is nothing to indicated when depositing a check through Mobile that it is different from ATM and Branch deposits and courtesy funds are NOT made available. In addition, if you should decide ( say because you are mad about the deception around courtesy funds ) to cancel the deposit, you 'll then learn that you can not cancel deposits placed via Mobile. Again nothing prior to placing the deposit via Mobile mentions these sharp differences between Mobile and ATM or Branch deposits. ( No courtesy funds, no ability to cancel deposits ). The only advice I received from speaking to Chase reps was to essentially present the check at another bank with faster processing which would then force cancel the Mobile deposit as a 2nd presentation. I feel there should be specific wording clarifying the differences between Chase Mobile Deposits and their ATM  Branch deposits. Namely that courtesy funds will NOT be available and it is NOT possible to cancel a deposit once initiated.   ",lin551@purdue.edu,0

He stated that opt-out meant my overdrafts would be paid. He said everyone was opted out automatically and they could change to opt-in and not pay overdrafts. I said,  Really at XXXX they said opt-in meant paying overdrafts. '' I finally forced him to find me a copy of the account terms and conditions he was making me acknowledge receiving. He had no idea what I was requesting and tried to tell me the signature card page I signed was the Deposit Account Agreement and then tried to say the pricing schedule was it. I was persistent that there were additional account terms he had n't provided and they likely called it a handbook. He ran to a different area of the branch to look for one. Why are n't the account opening disclosures available at the desk where they make you open an account? Why does n't the personal banker know what the account agreement is? Finally, when he came back with the booklet ( Deposit Account Agreement ), I quickly flipped to the overdraft section and showed him the page on overdrafts. I read him the line that said opt-in meant paying my overdrafts and I wanted to be opted in. He said,  Oh, I was confusing the terms, but I can easily check a box to change that. '' I said,  I do n't have to do anything else? '' and he said,  no. '' I did not receive a separate notice describing the overdraft practice or a confirmation of opt-in.   I called the XXXX number to inquire about my opt-in status on XXXX/XXXX/15 since I did n't receive an overdraft confirmation or notice. She confirmed I was opted in.

It is hugely surprising that a supervisor is unable to waive a fee or did n't care about the details of a regulatory violation.   I think this is a problem that has impacted several other customers.

On Wed XXXX XXXX at approx XXXX in the XXXX I checked my bank account and noticed a pending overdraw in my XXXX account in the amount of {$27.00}. This is despite the fact that I have overdraft protection which should have covered the overdraft. Perhaps since it was a  pending '' overdraft it had n't kicked in. So TO BE SURE TO AVOID OVERDRAFT OR FEES I got out of bed, put my boots on and walked through the snow to the bank ( at XXXX ) and deposited XXXX dollar to cover the pending overdrawn account. When I got home I checked online and my account was covered, no pending overdraw, no negative.   My XXXX account was also in the positive.   So I went to bed sure that I had avoided overdrawing my account.   When I woke up this morning XXXX XXXX and checked my account online my account XXXX was overdrawn by XXXX which included a late fee. The amounts shown were totally different than they had been the night previous ( ie. the debits were in amounts exceeding what was shown only hours earlier so it was not an accurate reflection of anything in my account ) But even more disturbing, my account ending in XXXX, which only hours earlier was positive with nothing pending, was now overdrawn by {$130.00}. WITH XXXX LATE FEES and balances that bore no resemblance to what my account had shown only hours before. I know as a fact my account was positive only hours before.     The check for XXXX that had supposedly overdrawn my account on XXXX XXXX had now mysteriously appeared, though I know as a fact that it had not appeared in my account on XXXX XXXX because I was at the atm and online at XXXX on XXXX XXXX checking my account.   Chase has always had a  pending '' period during which I could cover a pending debit. Not only did this now happen, but transactions appeared a day later than they HAD SUPPOSEDLY POSTED. This is either a glitch or a purposeful way to cheat people. Either way, it 's wrong.   My online and atm balances were not accurate and there was simply no way for me to responsibly keep my balance positive.. I WAS AT THE BANK AT XXXX to put money in and check my accounts!!!   I now have XXXX dollars in unfair fees that clearly I ca n't afford.   Of course Chase wo n't help. 'All my fault ' is all they say But this was not my fault or fair.

Chase 's online and atm balances were not accurate and did not provide information to me to allowed me to monitor my accounts.

6030,"I opened a youth savings and checking account for my son with USAA Federal Savings Bank a few years ago. When he turned XXXX he became the primary on the accounts. He saw unauthorized transactions on the accounts on XXXX XXXX, at which time he also discovered his debit card and driver 's license were stolen. He reported the unauthorized activity to the bank the same day and they stated they would forward this information to the fraud department to investigate and get back to him. Someone mobile deposited XXXX checks in the amount of {$4500.00} each and what looks like an electronic deposit of {$2900.00} to his account and immediately withdrew {$90000.00}. He is a student so this activity should have been a red flag for the bank. We asked why someone was allowed to deposit XXXX checks via mobile phone and withdraw them without a hold of 5-7 days. The representative said she was only taking the report and we could speak to someone in another department regarding that. Once the report was completed she transferred us to another department and we were never given a clear answer why something like this was not caught sooner by the bank and the account put on hold until resolved. Instead, my son never received a return call, he called them and was told he was being held responsible and they no longer wanted to do business with him. They gave him no reason or supporting information on what they found during their investigation. He requested this information and was sent from department to department until he was frustrated and hung up. He sent written requests asking for their findings after the investigation and they never responded. Instead, the following day after they received the second set of written requests, they closed his account. This was just very unexpected from USAA because I have been a loyal customer for over 20 years and they have always provided the best customer service. In this instance, it seems like they allowed suspicious transactions that should have been flagged to proceed and now they are holding my son and now me ( because they have added my name back to all correspondence ) now that they have  determined '' these were not unauthorized transactions. Yet, how did they come to this conclusion, did they determine who uploaded the mobile checks?, do they have ATM footage of the person ( s ) who withdrew the funds?, etc. The withdrawals were in {$400.00} - {$500.00} increments so they should have ATM footage. Did they check the XXXX XXXX to see if they have footage of the first unauthorized transaction listed as a debit or credit card transaction?

They state they investigated the matter and found the transactions were not fraudulent. We are saying the transactions were fraudulent and want the bank to supply my son with their findings so we can properly resolve this matter. At this point, we are being told they investigated the matter but they will not supply us with proof of this after multiple requests. They took my name off of correspondence when my son turned XXXX but now my name has been added back to correspondence since they deem the transactions our responsibility stating they XXXX report both of us to the credit reporting agencies.

6031,"I have a checking account with Citi and the bank has a feature called Checking Plus which is activated when my account went into overdraft. Once the overdraft happened, Citi essentially creates a loan with the overdraft amount. However, unlike other banks where a subsequent deposit would go towards the overdraft, Citi does not used the deposit to repay the overdraft line of credit. Instead, it starts charging double digit interests on the overdraft amount and just takes the monthly minimum payment from my regular checking account. I just discovered this when I looked at my banking statement more closely. Basically, even though I have more than enough in deposits to cover the overdraft, Citi has been charging me double digit interest rates on the so-called loan.

I do n't think this is a consumer friendly practice and this product is almost purposefully designed to get consumers to pay way more for the little convenience that they had offered for covering for the overdraft.

Two days ago I went into my branch and complained about this overdraft fee fiasco and the branch banker said she had absolutely no power to reverse fees because chase has in the past ... she did not care that past fee reversals were because of bank errors, hacked XXXX accounts, chase putting a hold on a chase quickpay payment to me because of it 's security concerns ... .none of those things mattered as I was smuggly told I have had too many fees reversed.

The check with my name raised an eyebrow because the date says I was a minor and in prison on the date. From what I know about this situation, when a minor receives a large amount of money, the funds must sit in an account with the parent monitoring it and it is unlawful for anyone to withdraw the cash without a judge or courts permission. To say the least no one except me or my mother should be able to withdraw and must present identification. The bank ( XXXX or Chase ) does not have paperwork about how the withdrawer has the ability to withdraw the funds because my mother tells me the money was sitting in a CD. There is no court order or copies of identification. My mother says the check in my name is my father- same name, using my money to pay his child support for me and the check in her name is the IRS forcing to pay her taxes. I have reason to believe the money I won was stolen from, I request the federal government to investigate and prosecute all people who was involved in the thievery of my money.

6085,"TD Bank has charged an overdraft fee for a situation in which we make a check deposit minus  cash ''. If there is not a balance in your existing checking account ( pre-deposit ) to cover the  cash '' portion that you are taking from your deposit, they charge an overdraft fee.  I understand that technically you are taking money off of a check that has not yet cleared so essentially you are taking withdrawal from you checking account but that is NOT explained to you at the time you are standing with the teller making the transaction. You do n't find out until you see the overdraft fee and call the bank to understand where its coming from.  The complaint is regarding a deceptive practice. Its fine if the policy is as it is but it should be the teller 's responsibility to tell the customer that they do n't have the money in their checking account to cover the withdrawal so they can either choose to take it against an alternative account that has the funds or they can take a lesser amount so they do not incur the fee, otherwise they will incur the fee.

In XXXX XXXX at my own expense ( as instructed ) I flew from XXXX to XXXX to authorise an international fund transfer. Shortly after returning back to XXXX I called the local banking centre that set up and approved my funds transfer to release my funds. Only to be instructed that I would need to re-visit a local banking centre within XXXX and complete another set of fund transfer forms because of an internal error. The customer support helpline said that the only department that had the authority to resolve this error was the ( BOA ) resolution department.

I was told that the banks help desk has no means of contacting the resolution department and only way to receive a response was if I wrote to them. Please be mindful that I have already spent over {$2000.00} dollars on the previous round trip to get to a BOA branch and now the dollar to pound exchange rate had weaken significantly.

The fact was for each call made I was required to repeat the whole history of the case to each new advisor including the steps and measures that I have already taken thus far.

Earlier this week I went into a Chase bank, as part of the JPMorganChase, N.A. conglomerate, XXXX, and spoke to a XXXX XXXX XXXX in an effort to obtain personal checks and an ATM card.

He was not available when I arrived so I waited for about 10-15 minutes, then had to leave without seeing him.

6128,"My complaint is with Bank of America and their horrible service/help, or lack their of, for a valued customer of 8 years. The incident started last year, XXXX. Up until XXXX XXXX I was married to my ex-husband. We separated in XXXX XXXX. During our marriage there was a XXXX account under my ex-husbands name. My name was never on that account and he was never on any bank account of mine nor was he able to have access to my card whatsoever. During our marriage ( before XXXX XXXX ), I was given cash by my husband about 2 times to pay a XXXX bill with my card. My card was never set for automatic withdrawal, my card was never connected to the XXXX account nor was my name ever connected to it or on any account. In fact, there was no account or company that my ex-husband and I both were on with our names together. Around XXXX XXXX, I contacted XXXX because I saw they had automatically withdrawn money from my bank using my card and I specifically told them they were not allowed to do so and I never gave them the authorization to use my card without my consent. So at this point, they agreed to not use my card without my consent and also to take it off file. This is on record and can be heard through XXXX 's  supposed '' recording process (  for quality purposes '' ) they have when you call their customer service department where the associate agreed to take my card off file. On XXXX XXXX, XXXX, a charge of {$670.00} was applied to my card and the money was taken out of my bank account, per XXXX XXXX. As a battered ex-wife coming out of an abusive relationship and being the person to leave, I had every notion that my ex-husband had used my card ( which he had that information because he secretly saved it ). I had every notion that my ex-husband used my card to pay his XXXX XXXX bill. A charge for {$670.00} from XXXX XXXX is unheard of but it happened to me. I contacted XXXX XXXX numerous times, countless times, to fix the charge, they agreed they withdrew money using my card without my consent but refused to fix it. Now I contacted Bank of America with this concern and I filed a claim for fraud against my ex-husband and Direct TV. Bank of America gave me a temporary credit of {$670.00} for that charge, but failed to mention, when the claim was denied, the actions they were going to take. After 90 days ( XXXX XXXX ), Bank of America withdrew the {$670.00} from my bank account and reversed the temporary credit denying my claim of fraud. This put my account overdrawn. Bank of America said XXXX XXXX took the money out without my consent and my ex-husband did not. This was a surprise to me but either way, I was never contacted about money being withdrawn from my account. How I found out was an email the next day of notice that {$670.00} was taken out of my account and my account was overdrawn. Bank of America stated that XXXX XXXX has a contract where they automatically pay a due amount with any card previously used on file. I, in fact, told DTV to remove my card from the account around XXXX XXXX, as I stated ... apparently they did n't. I was never aware of this contract nor was I ever on the DTV account to know of this either. After the initial fraud claim, we refiled the claim as an unauthorized charge claim. BOA denied my second claim of an unauthorized charge, since they said my first claim of fraud was incorrect. Bank of America did not work with me, did not do anything in my favor. They did n't care my account went negative. They are complying with XXXX XXXX and going against my claim and a knowingly unauthorized charge. After numerous calls to BOA cust service, every representative agreed it was wrong of XXXX and they did it without my consent. But Bank of America does n't care to help their customers.

The sales rep ( XXXX ) quickly read through the paperwork as I signed it. I trusted what he said and was reading it was accurate since it was many pages long. I wanted to wait to sign it when I had more time but he ( and I ) was in a hurry to get it processed so I could get it going for the store so I signed it as he read it to me ( upside down at that ). I know this sounds stupid but I have been dealing with this bank for YEARS and trusted them implicitly. A few months later my store hit hardship and I tried to buy out of my years lease because I seen the store was going to be closing it looked like due to me becoming very ill.

The person on multiple occasions went to out of state chase branch location and withdrew monies using a withdrawal slip. The person had the possession of my ssn number and had a fake drivers license issued under my name. I first noticed it on XXXX XXXX XXXX evening on my chase transaction history and immediately called the customer service and notified them. I went to my local chase branch next day to inform them and to file a claim. While the banker was going through my historical transactions, she noticed XXXX additional fradulent transaction on XXXX/XXXX/XXXX on XXXX account and XXXX additional fraudulent transactions on the XXXX account on XXXX and XXXX ( XXXX ). I filed a police report on the same day ( XXXX/XXXX/XXXX ) for identity theft and informed the police of my situation.

Finally around XXXX XXXX when i called my local banker, she informed me that my case was approved and i should receive the money. Since I did not receive money, i called the customer service again on XXXX and they left a voicemail for chase fraud dept to call me back. I got a call on XXXX from chase saying my whole claim is denied as I failed to report it within 90 days and it was due to my negligience. The lady i spoke to in chase fraud dept was not reach to reconsider my appeal and said i have to go through other means outside of bankand she can not help me.

I had also setup alerts on withdrawalsonmy chase account and they had stopped working. I was not even aware of these transactions until my banker pointed them out. I feel that bank is wrongly holding this against me and denying the whole claim.  I feel the chase branch in XXXX did not do proper due deligience on multiple occasions and i am totally shocked on how they handle the withdrawals at local branch. Here is the summary of all the different occasions where the chase branch failed to do the due diligence and were negligient which resulted in the person being able to withdraw the monies.  1. Bank failed to validate the signature and drivers license 2. Bank failed to raise an alert when the person walked in to branch almost every day, that too in a different state from where i live. The person never had a debit card every day and still bank failed to raise alert and without much care gave away the money.  3. I am also a employee of chase so the bank already should have known that i am not working in XXXX and withdrawing cash every day from XXXX should have raised an alert.  4. I had setup chase alerts on my accounts when i opened them. They stopped working at some point and i never received any alerts. I was relying on them to notify me in case of any withdrawals but they failed to alert.  5. This last XXXX is a bummer which tells how inefficient and negligient this whole proceess is with chase banking. I closed out my impacted accounts on XXXX/XXXX/XXXX and put my account on fraud alert by visiting the local branch in XXXX. I opened new checking account and savings account. 2 days later, the same person unaware of the whole situation, walked into the same branch from where he was withdrawing monies before. He wrote the same old account number which was now in restricted status and my account was on fraud alert. The teller failed to detect this, striked out the old account number, wrote down the new account number which i opened couple days before and still allowed the person to withdraw the money.I felt that the bank manager could have easily handed him to police.

I had a safety deposit box at the one on XXXX which I closed out XX/XX/XXXX due to my retirement and inability to travel on base. I returned the keys and transferred the box to the XXXX location.

My wife thought the bill was from the XXXX XXXX. branch and paid it for the last 3 years When I rented the box on XXXX XXXX, I also opened a savings account which they deducted the rent annually. When the amount in the account dropped below the rental amt., they deducted the balance and created a overdrawn situation. They, in turn, have charged me a penalty along with some type of interest charge for approximately {$50.00} and are currently saying I own {$110.00}. In calculating the penalty, they have pyramided the bill which is against the law.  I have closed out the box on XXXX but was told, I could not close the savings account because I still owed {$110.00} even though my wife has made three {$45.00} payments on the base box which I did not owe.

Not a single cent has been removed for this account, but we are now in debt for the taxes!

6352,I bank with BB  T. They seem to want to charge money to speak with their customers over the phone. From what I always understood was that I get XXXX free calls a month. I had not called the bank for 2 months because of this I do not want to pay these fees. Today I decided to give them a call about a transfer that I performed late last week and since it still was not showing on my account I thought I would give them a call. Before I proceeded I asked am I being charged for the call and the representative confirmed that I was not since it was the first call of the month. After I explained why I was calling she apologized and stated that she needed to transfer the call to online banking. XXXX answered the call I confirmed with her if I would be charged for the call she said if she answer my question then yes I would be charged. I said well that is OK I will not present the question because I do not want to be charged. She said that she would waive the fee. I then asked why would I be charged when this was the first call of the month and the other representative was not able to answer my question so I was not clear if they charge for all online questions or if they were charging because I spoke with XXXX representatives in one day. What ever the reason is they did not answer my question and besides this being that I have an account there I should be able to ask questions without the threat of having fees to pay to receive answers. I sent them a email and here is what I said : I had a question about my transfer that I performed several days ago. I know that it says that it could take up to 3 days however since it was done late last week I thought today being Wednesday that it would be there by now. I have not called or spoke with anyone in XXXX 3 months and now today I simply called in to ask about my transfer and the representative confirmed that I would not get charged for the call. I have learned to ask about this due to being charged in the past. She apologized and confirmed that she was not able to answer my question then connected me to online banking. Before I asked her a question I wanted to confirm if I were being charged and she said if she answer my question then yes I was going to get charged I then proceeded to say please do not answer my question because I do not want to be charged. XXXX then stated that she would waive the fee. My question is what is this I have an account with this bank however as I work on my financial health and future in order for me to get my questions answered I have to pay with the money that I am trying to save? My apology however I will not be able to pay for your services. I am putting my money into the savings account because I need to save my money. I will reach out to the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau at this point because I sincerely feel like I am being taken advantage of and this should not be the experience in regards to banking. I should be able to freely bank where ever I choose without the threat of being charged to get my questions answered. Please ensure that I will not be charged for that last call because as I stated she never answered my question.

On XXXX XXXX, 2016, I contacted USAA to inquire about interest payments being credited and then simultaneously debited to my CD. Specifically, without written or verbal explanation the crediting and then debiting activity occurred on the dates of XXXX/XXXX/16, XXXX/XXXX/16 and XXXX/XXXX/16.   When I contacted USAA, I was asked by the USAA representative if I had recently opened any new USAA accounts and had not provided a signature card to which I replied no to both questions. While on the phone, the USAA representative asked me to hold several times while she checked on my account status. After this had gone on for about 25 minutes, it appeared there was not going to be a timely response to my inquiry ; I asked the USAA representative if it might be possible for her to call me back. I noted that I was expecting an important call from the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs that I could not miss. Both the representative and supervisor seemed indifferent to the fact I was a XXXX Veteran and needed to communicate to the Department of Veterans Affairs that several of my prescriptions needed to be refilled promptly.   The USAA representative stated that she would not be able to call me back and that I must continue to hold on the phone until she had resolved the issue with my CD account. I then asked to speak with a supervisor and stayed on the line for another 10 minutes waiting until the connection with USAA was lost. Thinking that someone would call me back ( the USAA representative had already asked for my identifying information and thus had access to all my contact phone numbers ), I waited about 30 minutes before calling USAA customer service and asked to speak with a supervisor. I was told by the supervisor, that USAA implemented a policy about three ( 3 ) years ago whereby it does not call customers back to provide information concerning their respective accounts.   At present, I still do not know why, unlike in the past, I am not being credited with interest to which I am entitled for my CD account. ",dcherian@purdue.edu,1

Citi is likely counting on these customers not fighting back on this, but it is time someone like me takes a stand on this.

6475,"I have recently been the victim of a series of fraudulent charges, all in relatively small amounts between $ XXXX-XXXX, over the course of the months from XX/XX/XXXX - XX/XX/XXXX. I became aware of these charges on XX/XX/XXXX, after the criminals had slowly drained my business account of over {$6000.00}.   When I finally realized what had been happening, I reported it immediately to my financial institution, Chase, at my local branch in XXXX XXXX, CA on XXXX XXXX. They could see quite clearly that the charges were fraudulent and expected the funds to be returned in a couple days.   On XXXX XXXX, I received an email that {$3900.00} would be transferred into my account ( already far short of the approximately {$6500.00} due ). Later that day I received notice that my claim was denied. I have escalated this to the extent of my ability and have received nothing positive whatsoever. Chase is telling me directly that their refusal to refund is my responsibility, as I should 've reported far earlier - this of course, dependent on knowing what happened, and I did n't.   A bit more explanation : The charges were all from a XXXX station in XXXX, CA - a place I 've never been. I do, however, buy gas, etc ... at XXXX in XXXX XXXX, so if I see  XXXX - {$65.00} '' on a statement, I do n't think anything of it. Simply not an odd charge.   Chase has informed me that my claim is invalid because the original charges were more than 35 days prior to me reporting them, which they claim is backed up by federal regulations that were in effect 9 years ago when I opened the account, something I doubt very much.   They also claim that because I accessed my account online via the QuickPay app on my phone, that I must have NECESSARILY seen these charges and just neglected to report them, something that defies all reason. I use that app to quickly pay my rent and my doctor.   Chase fully encourages the use of mobile banking, making it exceedingly easy to miss individual charges like I did. Chase also encourages electronic statements available online. I do n't receive my statement in the mail, nor do I receive it in email. An email that states it 's  available to view '' is n't the same as having the text in your face.   Yet they are adamant that even though they 've found multiple ways to discourage their customers from actually tracking their transactions, it 's still the customer 's fault to do so - in the course of our conversations they 've even said that fraud must be reported in 24 hours in some cases. Who lives their lives like this?   As it stands now, they are telling me they ca n't return a huge amount of money ( to me ) because of when the undeniably fraudulent activity began longer than 35 days prior to my reporting, and they imply that I was somehow complicit in it by 'knowing ' and not reporting it. They also tell me that even the charges within the 35 days prior to my reporting are denied.   All of this is premised on the idea that the funds are unrecoverable. That is clearly contradictory.. If they have 35 days, they could 've recovered at least those funds. They chose not to act at all for 31 days. Also, since all of the fraud was of the same variety and from the same source, if they 're able to track and recover the most recent charges, they certainly should be well within legal reasoning to recover the rest. Instead they 're completely obstinate in the face of a customer complaint.   I 've been a Chase business customer for 9 years. I 've had them alert me of fraudulent charges in the past, and I 've also noticed some myself and have had to report them. They 've left my account exposed repeatedly.   Their ONLY job is to protect my money and provide the services I need. They 've done neither, and in turn they 've blamed it on me.   They also refuse to accept any holes in their fraud detection system. ",wu649@purdue.edu,1

This is very unfortunate in that in the seven months this account has been open, numerous Citi reps have confirmed my enrollment in this promotion, eligibility and satisfaction of the promotion requirements to earn the bonus for this checking account. The last Citibank rep I spoke with told me that the points would post within 90 days of meeting the requirements. Only now, after they have collected fees for 90 days of waiting, did Citi decide to inform me that I am not eligible. If I was ineligible, why was I not informed earlier? I understand that Citibank reserves the right to 'target ' specific customers for promotional offers, however, the onus is then also on them screen applicants who apply for their eligibility for said offers. Instead, I was able to open an account under this promotion, and then falsely told multiple times that I would receive a bonus which is now not being honored.

In XXXX, I attempted to get a loan modification through Bank of America. State of MD posted that modifications were available even if you were n't behind but anticipated problems. I was on time for my payment for both mortgages, but my wife lost her job. We asked for a loan modification for over a year, with no response.

This went on for over a year, including work with a local liaison that worked for the county to work with the banks on load modifications. We applied again and again. After about 18 months we were told that we technically qualified for the loan modification based on the requirements, but the owner of the loan did n't want to modify.

6519,"My wife and I applied to open a joint online savings account at GS Bank on XXXX XXXX. After 3 days of not hearing from them, I called them to check status of the account opening. Representative indicated they were declining to open an account because they could not verify my wife 's identity. GS Bank did not explain why they were unable to verify the identity of my wife of over 10 years, despite us both having many other joint accounts and credit cards with other banks over the years. Representative said a letter would be forthcoming from GS Bank explaining reason for declination, however, no such letter has arrived. Having supplied GS Bank with all of our personal information in order to apply, I find it unconscionable that they can refuse to open the account, not explain why, and yet continue to keep all of our information on file.

I received no notice in the mail on this item and was assessed XXXX sustained overdraft fees during this period. The first was on XXXX and the second sustained overdraft fee on XXXX both for {$30.00}. I understand the initial overdraft fee being assessed of XXXX. However, I find the sustained overdraft fees to be abusive and predatory in nature. Not long ago, sustained overdraft fees were generally applied after 10 business days. This time of 10 days allowed for the notification time that may occur for when a client may not be aware of this event. In my case, XXXX were applied before 10 calendar days occurred. Out of curiosity, I used an interest rate calculator to determine what this interest rate might be if I were to convert this small matter to a loan situation and I was told that the calculator could not estimate the rate because it was too large. So I adjusted the amount I was negative to XXXX ( but in reality XXXX ) against the total amount I would pay to rectify the matter of XXXX and the interest rate amounted to 192 %, which I believe is above predatory.

I found it astounding that all but {$.00} was withdrawn from by XXXX year-old daughters account and I never received a written statements, a phone call and/or any type of notification to let me know that over XXXX debit card transactions were completed on this account.

US Bank is holding our funds hostage to prevent the purchase of the replacement car, groceries, and whatever else we might need for the principle of fraud protection.  I own a home, I have my XXXX children, and my wife has her XXXX children. We are both employed. We previously transacted our banking with a credit union. The replacement vehicle is essential to our health, well being and employment. The implication of their anti-fraud effort is insulting and unnecessary.

As a result, I have been dealing with this situation for three months with no resolution. As the chain of events are read, I 'm perplexed as there is no process in place for situations like this. I 'm certain I 'm not the first or will be the last person to be faced with this issue. Additionally, I realize the amount is minimal but at this point it 's the principle of not having a process in place and someone other than my son received {$140.00}.  Chain of Events : 1. Took advantage of the process to send my son money ( a XXXX who resides in XXXX ) from my XXXX account to his Chase checking account via the XXXX XXXX vendor ( which was solicited through accessing my XXXX account ). This amount was for {$140.00} and sent on XXXX/XXXX/2016. The funds were immediately debited from my account.  2. My son accepted the transfer and completed a profile with XXXX XXXX to complete the process.  3. My son and I received notification the funds were available as of XXXX/XXXX/2016. However, when my son checked his account, the funds were never transferred as confirmed.  4. I contacted XXXX advising of the issue and was advised the funds were successfully transferred, to wait a few more days, and call back if the funds are yet to be transferred.  5. I waited and no transfer to my son 's Chase account. I called XXXX back and was advised I needed to contact Chase with tracking number, XXXX to see if they could track where the funds transferred.  6. My son and I called Chase on a conference call and explained the situation, the representative confirmed the funds did not transfer and advised they could n't help. The representative suggested to file a claim with my bank ( XXXX ). I advised I took those actions already hence the reason for the call. The representative laughed and advised I must be clear on advising my bank I need to file an ACH claim.  7. I called XXXX again and advised of the situation. I was then advised there was absolutely nothing they could do and I needed to call the vendor for resolution.  8. My son and I called the vendor on a conference call and was advised they could n't assist with a resolution and I needed to call my bank and/or Chase. I advised both actions were taken hence the reason we are contacting them. The representative then advised they would attempt to look into it but unlikely they 'd be able to assist.  9. My son nor I heard back from the vendor as advised, so I decided to send an online inquiry to XXXX requesting to open an ACH claim as I 've been going back and forth with all parties with no resolution.  10. After several online inquiries, XXXX submitted a claim with the vendor for further research.  11. A month went by without a response or resolution. I sent another online inquiry to XXXX and received a response indicating there was nothing the vendor could do and I needed to contact Chase for resolution. I advised again that my son and I went down that route with no resolution. The XXXX representative working my claim attempted to contact Chase directly but was advised there was nothing they could do unless possibly my son, myself, XXXX and Chase are on a conference call. I advised at this time with my son 's and my schedule it would be too challenging to attempt to coordinate such a call. Also, I 've spent too much time already attempting to resolve this matter with all parties as suggested.

( State Farm Bank advertised its rates CD rates on the internet ). I spoke with a customer service rep who said he was an IRA specialist. I explained that I wanted to transfer funds from an already existing traditional IRA at a different bank, and would also be making a 2016 contribution to the new State Farm Bank IRA account. The service rep said that he would help me open the IRA account. He said that he would be filling out the application form on the phone and would be asking me a series of questions.

At the very end of the application process, I was told that the State Farm Bank service rep would be choosing a local State Farm insurance agent whose name would be added to my IRA account as my insurance agent contact. I objected to having a stranger 's name listed as part of my IRA account. I said that I did not want any insurance agent 's name noted on my account, my application, my bank records, or my application form. I asked why he wanted to put a local State Farm insurance agent on my bank records, and he said that it was for marketing and sales purposes to advise me of the State Farm 's products. I told him I already had insurance, had my own insurance agent, did n't want any solicitations from State Farm, and said that I was declining have a local State Farm insurance agent 's name listed as contact for my IRA account. The State Farm Bank service rep stated that he could not complete my IRA application form and State Farm Bank, as a matter of policy, could not open a bank account for me without having their insurance agent 's name indicated on the records of my bank account. I said that there were no federal banking laws that required me to have the name of an insurance agent noted on my IRA account. He replied that without a State Farm insurance agent listed on my IRA account records, I would not be allowed to open a bank account at State Farm Bank. He stated that it was bank policy to require this, and that the requirement to have their local insurance agent listed on my IRA account records complied with all federal laws. I asked him to bring his supervisor into the conversation so that I could  opt out '' of this requirement. I explained that a bank account had the customer 's personal and private identifying information along with confidential financial information. I did not want an insurance agent to have access to this information, and I had a right to privacy. The supervisor reiterated to the service rep that unless I allowed the local State Farm insurance agent 's name to be placed on my account as my contact for the account, State Farm Bank would have to refuse to open the bank account for me.  The service rep promised that he would add the words  no soliciting '' to my record. I told him that this was not acceptable, that I did not want the names of any local insurance agents listed on my bank account records. The State Farm Bank service rep refused to open an IRA account at the bank without my being assigned a local State Farm insurance agent by the bank to be listed on my bank account records. I was told repeatedly that I would not be allowed to open an account at the bank.

We can also show faxes, witnesses, police reports, emails, phone records right on down the line and the fact we never were once late with a credit card bill, ever, we always paid more than was expected. So how come if we always paid on time and kept up with other monthly bills did USAA put our credit card in collections when we sent them identity theft paperwork on the credit card and checking account. Falsely putting credit card in collections itself has cost us major health, job, credit issues we never ever had as well as a whole breed of fake things on your credit. The headaches alone we go through daily and the loss in our lives is extreme. Not to mention the dozen of unpaid policy renters and automobile things need to be paid. But even from the first issue when we were massively identity theft through our checking, even though we ended up finding out who it was and there was an arrest and witness to came to us and testified to the culprit wrong doings, the whole time we had money missing from our accounts prior to finding out what was going on USAA BANK was rude and uncaring and told me that it was probably my boyfriend at the time doing it and I should have him arrested. WHAT KINDA COMMENT IS THAT. And after we found out who did it, when we called to let USAA BANK know XXXX ( ext XXXX ) screamed at XXXX XXXX when he was trying to be kind and let them know what was going on, she did not care, she was more concerned if we wanted anything from them.

She had the Supervisors looking in the computer in the customer service area for the transaction, could not find it. I concluded that all the swiping that was done, one swipe recorded the charge and ends up on my ST checking account as a check # XXXX for {$280.00}?, no date when it was written, but it was paid the XXXX.

From XXXX XXXX through XXXX XXXX, First Niagara Bank charged my company over {$3700.00} in analysis service charges.

XXXX was for {$25.00}, and XXXX for {$46.00}. On XXXX XXXX they were in the pending column and I had over {$800.00} in my account. More than enough to cover them! That evening, my landlord deposited my rent check for {$1400.00}. This was after the XXXX XXXX XXXX charges! I was charged for XXXX overdraft charges instead of just XXXX. The {$1400.00} check caused the overdraw, not the XXXX XXXX XXXX charges. This is not fair!! how do these people do their accounting! They do it to maximize the overdraft amounts they can take due to their process of  re-ordering '' payments. I called them about this and asked them to refund the charges. they would not. I told them I am always grateful, as they pay about 95 % of my overdraws, but when it is not warranted ( as in this case ) I do not want to pay overdraft fees. They would not help me because they said they have already returned fees to me. This bank has returned fees to me due to the fact that they should have not taken them! I often do not say a word to them when I feel the charge is warranted. These charges are not. I have complained to this agency before about them. Why is something not done? This is just another form of  high to low '' checking that they use to collect fees.  A few weeks ago they charged me XXXX overdraft fees, and then {$12.00} to transfer money from my way to save account ( the transfer was for {$5.00}, and they charged {$12.00} for this!! ). I am sick of this type of thing. Since when does it cost a bank {$12.00} to transfer someones ' money??? I do n't even think they are allowed to charge more than XXXX fees in one day, so they waited till the next day to post the {$12.00} fee, even though the money transfer was on the same day as the XXXX overdraft fees. I want that {$12.00} returned to me, as well as the {$70.00} in overdraft fees that were unwarranted from XXXX/XXXX/16. I am a XXXX XXXX XXXX woman who is supporting her XXXX XXXX XXXX mother, and paying for a caregiver out of my own pocket!! That is why I overdraw! I have been with this bank for over 9 years. I do not like to overdraw, but sometimes it is a fact of life today. I do not complain to them when their fees are warranted, only when I feel they are unwarranted.  Pls see below in Italics complaint from the internet about their re-ordering of transactions.   try not to have an overdraft but it happens. On a Friday I made XXXX debit transactions at store. On Sunday I made XXXX debit transaction. I was off my balance by - {$1.00} cents. Wells Fargo took the Sunday Debit as being the largest and paid it, but the for small Debit I did on Friday they hit me up as an overdraft for XXXX transaction. It 's a scam with this bank. I showed it to my Credit Union at work. Once I can get all my direct deposits transferred to the Credit Union, I will be leaving this bank after 35 years. They are just bad news and judging by the hundreds of bad reviews, it tells me the bank does not care and will continue to cheat its customers.

The promotional code that I used for the {$250.00} checking bonus was n't expired until XXXX XXXX which was after when my account was established. This code was confirmed originally by the phone agent, and the bank should have kept the recording of this phone call as proof of my claim. Moreover, I also have email proof of this promotion sent by the bank so there is no denying from the bank for refusing to honor it. The worst thing was with their customer service which seemed to have mostly been trained to tell all customers that the promotion was not from the bank at all, and the bank website has been hacked or at least the promotion page was hacked to send out this bonus. I have NEVER heard such a ridiculous response from any other financial institutions before, and it is seriously shocking to learn that a good sized bank like BMO Harris could NOT honor its bonus for whatever reason.  The second issue is with the XXXX monthly fees charged. I have to say that their banking system is the worst I have ever dealt with, even credit unions are having better systems to make the process easy to use and streamlined for their customers. When I created my online banking account I expect everything to be automated and did NOT have to call customer service to get it to work. This has been my experience with any other financial institutions that I 've dealt with, however BMO Harris system is different and does n't work without manual intervention. The request for refunds is for the amount of time and trouble it caused me to set it up successfully. If I received the initial temporary password that your website was supposedly to send out, I would have completed the enrollment process in no time and transferred in enough funds to waive the monthly fees.  So to summarize, I 'd appreciate CFPB to work on my behalf with the bank in order for them to honor my bonus, and refund the fees charged inappropriately. Thank you very much. ",dai77@purdue.edu,0

6905,"I am XXXX XXXX XXXX and a few months ago went to open my first checking account with Chase Bank at XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX AZ XXXX. Everything was going fine. I had not overdrawn my account or did anything that I know of that was wrong. I was in a car accident and received an {$8000.00} check from an insurance company, which I deposited into my account. Part of this money was to go back to my parents to pay medical bills and other costs relating to my accident. The bank said there would be a 10 day hold on the check after which I would have access to it. The next day I tried to log on to online banking and was unable to do so because my password would not work. I called the bank and they said that they closed my account. They would not give me anymore information. That day I went into my bank and talked to a live person, who said the same thing, which was they could n't tell me why. I was concerned about the {$8000.00} deposit I had just made and the banker reassured me that they would be mailing me a cashier 's check for the money that was in my account in 10 days. That has not happened. My mother and I called Chase again asking about my money that they have been holding for over 2 weeks and also for an explanation as to why they closed my account. They still did not have any information or would not tell us anything. My parents are being harrassed by XXXX different medical facilities who are demanding payment from my accident. They can not pay them until I get MY money back from Chase. Can this possibly be legal? How can it take so long for them to give me my money back. I should have gotten it back the minute they closed my account. I ca n't afford an attorney but I need some help from someone who knows this kind of thing. The car accident I was in was not my fault. I was banged up pretty bad but the worst part was my car was totaled. I had it for one year and had been fixing it up the whole time. The car was finally perfect and I got to enjoy it for 8 months before a bad driver smashed it up. I was very stressed and sad for 2 months. I finally got some money for my  inconvenience '' from the other insurance company, which made me happy. I deposited this into my Chase account. After paying my medical bills, I was going to get to keep the rest of the money. I thought I would now be able to put the memories of my bad car accident behind me and move on. But, Chase Bank is preventing me from doing just that. Chase Bank is now causing me and my family a lot of stress all over again. I talked to another banker where I opened my new account and asked them how this could happen. They said usually there are XXXX reasons a bank will close someone 's account. Fraud or not getting along with the customer. I certainly have n't committed any fraud and I have never set foot into Chase Bank except for the day XXXX opened my account several months ago and again several weeks ago to inquire about my account getting closed. So, I never interacted with anyone that could say they found me hard to get along with. Please check into this for me. Thank you for your help. ",zhan1565@purdue.edu,0

When I tried to open a checking and savings account I was told there was an account already opened up under my name. The rep told me if the account was not mine, which is was not I would have to file through their fraud claims process. Here we are now 7 months later, after chase has put me through hundreds of phone calls to them, endless paper work and documents etc. Chase made this process nothing but easy, all the reps that I would work with at their executive office would never call me back. I would have to call daily and follow up on the account. Finally I got confirmation from Chase bank telling me that they approved my fraud claim and was not liable for anything and non of this would effect me. I was last speaking with a man by the name of XXXX and a woman XXXX XXXX. XXXX XXXX knew my situation and told me once the fraud case was approved in my favor I would be able to open an account. Why would I go threw 7 months of phone calls with Chase and letter and constantly following up with them for no outcome? XXXX XXXX told me once the fraud claim was approved that she would reach out to the chase branch and inform them that it was ok for me to open the account. This was about a month ago. Finally after leaving XXXX about a dozen voicemails I never got a call back. So I went to Chase.com and opened the account online. A few days later chase canceled my account. When I called in to Chase executive offices to find out why after they promised they would open they gave me a whole different story. I called to the main number and spoke with a man named XXXX he told me that XXXX was on leave. He told me that I was a risk to the bank and that the bank did not want to do business with me. I said how is this possible? I said Chase put me threw a difficult fraud claim process over 7 months, Chase told me the account was not mine and confirmed it was opened fraudulently. XXXX could not really answer my question, other than to say that It was Chase 's compliance department that would not let me open the account because I am a risk because someone opened up an account under my name. This makes no sense to me! I have been more than pacitent. It is not apparent to me that my initial concerns of Chase trying to discriminate against me as a XXXX male trying to bank at the same bank as my partner are true. How can I be responsible for an account that someone else opened up under my name. Chase is clearly discriminating against me as a XXXX male. Please see attached paper work for the approval letters.If Chase does n't comply with what they promised I have no choice but to turn to social media and let the world know how Chase treats their XXXX customers.

XXXX provided copies of the Repair Order Contract, Final Invoice, Completion Certificate and Guaranty of Payment all signed by the customer to the merchant services. After review charge back was returned to XXXX. In XXXX 2016 we received another letter from Wells Fargo Merchant Services stating the card holder insisting he he is not satisfied with the service and claiming he has contacted XXXX and he was denied service or refund without any specifics. Once again XXXX responded with another letter to Merchant Services that neither XXXX repair center nor the XXXX toll free Customer Service has any record of the alleged customer ever contacting us to report any claim or dispute of any kind. We requested the XXXX XXXX to have the card holder contact us for followup. We have tried to contact the card holder via the contact information he had provided on his invoice in XXXX and have left voice mail with no reply. Wells Fargo Merchant Service returned the charge back to the card holder favoring card holder 's claim of contacting XXXX and refusal of XXXX to provid service or refund. We have requested Wells Fargo to provide us with any specifics, information dates time etc and they have not been able to. Rules and regulations in Charge Back Management Guideline for Visa Merchant Section XXXX : XXXX XXXX, states :  The cardholder claims that the terms of the sale were misrepresented by the merchant for this reason, the cardholder must have made a valid attempt to resolve the dispute or return the merchandise.Based on information provided and the card holder 's attempts to avoid having contact with XXXX, and XXXX 's inability to reach the cardholder via contact information he had provided thus preventing XXXX to have any opportunity to examine and substantiate any claim, we believe this is a classic case of what is referred to as Friendly Fraud. Fraud is one of the most common methods cardholders use to file a chargeback. Chargeback fraud occurs when a customer files a chargeback on a legitimate transaction instead of following the merchant 's procedures for requesting a refund. Well-intentioned customers may accidentally commit chargeback fraud because they are ignorant of the differences between a traditional refund and a bank-issued refund. They do n't know what chargeback fraud is and incorrectly assume a chargeback is simply an easier way to get their money back.Other consumers are aware of the loopholes in the chargeback process and knowingly abuse this consumer protection mechanism. For example, a customer will authorize a credit card transaction and later file a fraudulent chargeback once the item has been received. In this case, chargeback fraud is committed in the hopes of getting something for free. We believe the Wells Fargo Bank Merchant Services is in direct violation of Visa Chargeback Management Guide Section XXXX : Chargeback Reason Codes XXXX Merchant Services has failed to investigate the dispute to verify if the card holder 's claims of contacting XXXX and XXXX refusal is true. As a result XXXX has been defrauded. Please investigate and advise. Thank you XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXXXXXXXXXX ",pearson9@purdue.edu,0
6927,Summary : I did not receive the bonus points that came with a promotional offer Citi was offering even after they have confirmed it via live chat and secured message.   Events : Opened a Citigold Checking account during XXXX 2016. There was a promotion of getting XXXX XXXX XXXX Aadvantage miles for opening said account and completing certain requirements. The requirements were : 1. Use the bill pay function in two consecutive months 2. Make {$1000.00} in debit card purchases with the Citi debit card.   Confirmed with Citi representatives via Live Chat and Secured Message on XXXX/XXXX/16 that I have completed all the requirements and was eligible for the bonus points during XX/XX/XXXX and had to wait 90 days ( starting from the following month ) for the points to be posted onto my XXXX XXXX account. I should have received the bonus points by XXXX/XXXX/16.   There is a $ 30 monthly fee for keeping the account open. I kept the account open solely for waiting for my XXXX XXXX miles to post but they did not show up long after the 90 day mark. Contacted Citi soon after to ask when I will get the points and they said that I was not eligible for the bonus points. They did not even send me a notice saying when or how I was disqualified while I just kept waiting and paying the $ XXXX monthly fees for a total of {$90.00} to date.

6942,"Chase is preventing us from getting into our accounts online and not updating information in the accounts in a timely manner. When we travel, we use a different IP address to log into our accounts. Chase has taken it upon itself, without asking as other banks do, whether we want it to  recognize '' the computer/IP address we are using. It then locked us out when we logged in from another IP address. Recently, we were locked out of our accounts for 2.5 - 3 weeks because of this harassment. To add insult to injury, when we went into a local office of XXXX in XXXX, NJ, it demanded a new email address because its marketing junk email was bouncing. The guy deleted the old email that had been in the system for years and demanded another one. When he was told that we do n't use email, will not create an email account for Chase 's convenience, he said he would not restore the original email address that he had deleted without permission, then refused to restore. This obnoxious behavior typifies Chase 's actions : everything is for its convenience while it continues to deny clients easy access to their money and financial services it advertises and purports to provide.  Similarly, last night or the night before I checked our accounts online. Nothing had been updated since before the XXXX XXXX weekend. Then this morning, a bunch of checks and payments showed up, bringing the balance very low. Had it updated the online information in a timely fashion, we could have easily transferred money into the account before this weekend. As it is, we will need to stagger a credit card payment because Chase withheld critical account information from us. This has all occurred while Chase owes us roughly {$130.00} for a credit on their credit card that has been on there for roughly 2 months. it is clear that first it denies us access to our money and bill payment services ; then it withholds account activity information ; followed by a bunch of checks it had been holding, hoping to overdraw the account. This kind of petty harassment and capricious cessation of normal operations needs to be sanctioned effectively and sufficiently to deter it.

6972,"XXXX I opened the Citi Gold Checking account through a promotion offering XXXX XXXX XXXX miles.

I had to spend {$1000.00} on the debit card and complete XXXX bill pays within three months.   After the application was approved and I had created my online access, I sent a secure message to confirm that the promotional offer was indeed attached to my account and to reconfirm the promo rules. The secure message agent at Citi confirmed the promotional offer for the XXXX miles was attached to my account. A few days later I chatted with a Citi agent to check on the progress of my promotion and what I had completed so far. Again I was assured the promotional offer was attached to my account and I was told I had charged a few XXXX dollars to the debit card and had completed XXXX bill pay. After completing the requirements XX/XX/XXXX, I sent another secure message to Citi to inquire how long it would take for the miles to post. I was told by this agent the following :  I have submitted an investigation to confirm you have completed the required behaviors and qualify for the miles to be awarded to you. '' I then received a communication from Citi saying, essentially, I would not be getting the miles. This was despite the fact that several agents had told me otherwise, and despite the fact that I have screenshots of my application process proving I correctly applied using the promo code.   Since then the service at Citi has been pretty poor. I continue to get canned responses and no specific reasons as to why the offer wo n't be honored. Agents have assured me a follow-up investigation was opened, but it has been over two weeks since that happened and I have gotten no response. I feel I am being taken advantage of. Had I known Citi would not honor the promotional offer I applied through, I would have left my money in another savings account earning higher interest.   To top it off, my wife applied for the exact same promo offer on the exact same day and completed the requirements in the exact same time period and she has already received her bonus miles. So there is clearly something wrong on Citi 's end.   I would really appreciate some real help with this issue. I feel like Citi is not giving that to me, and is not holding up the bargain.

I read the terms of this promotion very carefully when signing up for the Citigold checking account, and there was no language indicating any reason that I would not have been eligible for this promotion.   After I completed these requirements and waited until the next billing period on my AAdvantage card, I was concerned that I did not receive the miles yet.

I opened a check ( {$220.00} ) that I had received from the United States Postal Service in front of him. He took the check, and I asked if I could receive a color copy. He said he could n't do a color copy, and instead asked if I wanted a B  W copy, to which I had declined.   He then proceeded to deposit the {$100.00} cash and asked if there was anything else I needed. I said no, and then the WF Point-of-Sale machine asked how I would like my receipt. I selected to have the receipt delivered electronically to my WF account inbox.   I had then remembered I needed to exchange some coins I brought from home. I mentioned this to him, and he seemed glad to help. He and I counted the coins together ( he used a plastic counting device ). The change amounted to a little more than {$10.00}, and he handed me a {$10.00} bill in addition to returning me some coins.   I thanked him, asking if there was anything else I needed to do.

I activated my account and received physical mail which I responded to to complete the new account process.   The requirements of receiving the new customer incentive offer was to use their eBill payment service for a period of 3 months after opening a new account - a requirement that I knew I could meet ( and did ).   A month after opening the checking account I called and spoke to a Citi Gold account representative to confirm that I was following all steps required to receive the promotion - I was assured I was doing everything as expected as per my promotion contract. I explicitly asked if after fulfilling my obligations that were part of the contract I would be eligible for the XXXX ThankYou points - his answer was  yes ''.

I went over the details of my promotion and the representative said that ALL THE REQUIREMENTS WERE MET and that the points should post to the account in 1-3 months.   In XXXX ( 5 months after opening the account ) I called to check the status of my promotional points. The representative that I spoke to was as confused as I was to why the points had not yet posted and opened a support ticket inquiry into the matter that would escalate the issue to their back offices. I waited a few days and then called back to find out the status of the inquiry. It was then that I was learned of their deceptive business practice.   The representative on the phone ( and later his supervisor when I asked to speak with her ) both told me that I was not part of their internal list of candidates for the promotion. Supposedly Citi mails/eMails out promotion codes only to certain prospective new customers and I was not on their internal list. This did not stop them from accepting my application with the referral code, taking my money, having their representatives confirm verbally my eligibility or charging me monthly account maintenance fees ( {$30.00} per month ) - all in an attempt to bait me into using their service with a non-existing reward at the end of the process.   I feel cheated by CitI Gold checking for taking my money in monthly fees ( {$30.00} per month ) only to deny me the sign up bonus that would have covered about a years worth of monthly fees. If I was not on their secret list of qualified customers, this should have been communicated MONTHS before wasting both time and money in a non-existing promotion. Why was I not confirmed or denied as soon as I signed up for a new account? Why were the representatives that I spoke to multiple times not made aware that I was not on their list for the documented bonus? Why should I have the responsibility of fulfilling the obligations of the promotion ( which I did withing the expected 3 month period ) and Citi not have the responsibility of rewarding that good behavior? Why should I comply with the terms on the contract only to have the same contract broken by Citi because I was later found not to be on their secret internal list of  qualified new customers ''?!   The only resolution I seek is for Citi to honor their promotional incentive and give me the XXXX ThankYou points as were promised. By denying me the contracted benefit this amounts to a deceptive business practice and feels like a bait and switch to get new customers without reciprocating any goodwill bonus.

I get the line from PNC reps that they can only offer a courtesy refund on charges once a year. But then as I go through my statements, some were refunded well within a year of each other.

7024,"XX/XX/XXXX First National Bank acquired XXXX branch offices from XXXX XXXX. As a result of this transaction both our checking account and savings account were automatically transferred to First National Bank on XXXX XXXX. Our mortgage remained with XXXX.  The XXXX XXXX Bank accounts were established ( XX/XX/XXXX ) as a contingency for receiving a mortgage. One requirement being to have the mortgage payment paid directly from the checking account. The only requirement on the savings account was to maintain a minimum of {$25.00} and all fees were waived.  At no time were we notified by either bank that this arrangement would change. In fact the mortgage was still automatically being deducted from the new First National checking account.  On XXXX XXXX we visited our local First National branch to withdraw our balances and to close our accounts. The checking account balance was what we expected but the savings account showed a balance of {$1.00}. I questioned this figure and the teller pulled up the account on her computer screen and explained that the reduced balance was the result of fees and finance charge for the account being inactive. I expressed my displeasure and the bank manager called the branch that was responsible for the account. She spoke with the assistant manager who offered to refund {$10.00} in addition to the {$1.00} balance but no more since we were closing the account.  As of XXXX XXXX we had not received a statement from First National or any communication about their policy on this savings account. As of this date, XXXX XXXX, XXXX, we have received only a notice of the account being closed. I am expecting to receive an end of quarter statement at the beginning of XXXX which I expect will agree with printout that I received from the teller on XX/XX/XXXX. It showed that the bank deducted {$10.00}  dormant account fee '' on XXXX XXXX. This is a mere 11 days after the account was transferred to First National. This was followed on XXXX XXXX with a {$4.00}  service fee '' and by another {$10.00}  dormant account fee '' on XXXX XXXX.  This whole thing over {$25.00} may sound petty but First National did the same thing to my daughter and her husband. I suspect that we are n't the only accounts that have been ripped off. This could be a substantial amount of money if they did this with every account that was transferred in the sale. ",jmccror@purdue.edu,0

I called in and the agent I spoke with could n't adequately explain the logic behind why I was charged. The way the information was listed on my account online suggested that I had enough funds in my account and that the overdraft fee is what overdrafted my account! At that time, they refunded an overdraft fee and helped me opt-out of the feature.   As it was explained to me, opting-out of their overdraft protection would PREVENT any overdraft scenarios from happening. This is clearly not the case.

However, had the payments posted in a different order, the lesser amount first, we would have only been charged XXXX over draft fee. PNC did refund XXXX of the fees because we are not in the habit of over drafting. The thing is, since I have no visibility into the auto-payment posting times, I ca n't be sure that PNC is not maximizing the fees charged to me by posting the smaller of the auto-debits first.

I have even opened up lines of credit for almost every checking account I have with them in order to avoid overdraft fees. I basically only deposit enough money in my M  T account to pay my monthly bills via web bill pay and checks. Their web bill pay is the only financial service of value to me. Their rates and service for loans, credit cards, etc are so poor that I never even consider them when shopping for other financial products such as a vehicle loan.  This week I happened to overdraft my account by {$1.00}. Fortunately I have a line of credit attached to the account so they did me a huge favor of transferring {$1.00} from that line instead of charging me the typical $ XXXX dollars for an overdraft. I watch my accounts constantly via XXXX so, seeing the transfer, I logged on the following day and transferred some money from XXXX of my other accounts ( I had over {$1000.00} on deposit with the institution at the time ) and then transferred the {$1.00} back to the line. For the service of providing me the {$1.00} for less than XXXX hrs, they decided to charge me {$12.00}. I work next to an M  T and have a great relationship with the manager, but as I 've learned from previous experience, the branches have no control over fees associated with the automated system, so I figured I would just call their customer service line and discuss this with someone there since they have effectively removed customer service from the branches. I discussed the situation with the customer service person who also had no ability to do anything at all. I understand the policy, I know what the fee is, and honestly I would care less about paying {$12.00} if they had to advance even {$50.00} on my behalf. But to have no money at all of their own at risk and to charge 833 % percent does not seem at all reasonable. I know it is within their rights per the agreement of use or whatever miscellaneous fine print I had to agree to in order to use web banking, overdraft lines of credit etc, but this is extremely usurious and many of their clients do n't have the means to absorb these kinds of fees routinely. If I could find an institution with equal web banking capabilities, I would close all of my accounts tomorrow. ",jmccror@purdue.edu,0

The bonus offered XXXX AAdvantage points after opening a CitiGold account and then scheduling two bill payments from the newly opened account and making at least {$1000.00} purchases with Debit Card.  Having completed the eligibility requirements, I inquired with Citi about when I would receive these points. I was extremely disappointed to hear from Citi about the outcome of case XXXX. After first offering the promotion, it appears Citi is refusing now to honor its promises.

I received the same form response that I was not eligible for the promotion without citing T  C of the original offer. While researching this issue online, I have found widespread complaints about Citi from other clients who found themselves in the same situation.  I am extremely unhappy as I am currently in processes of transferring my assets over to Citi, but this event has seriously undermined my trust to your bank since such marketing practices are deceptive and misleading.

A SunTrust manager at that location certified that funds were available in the new customer 's account.   4. Based on funds availability, I requested that the check be cashed, then used the funds to open a new SunTrust corporate account.   5. The very next day, I returned to the same SunTrust Bank branch to request a cashier 's check to be issued from my newly opened corporate account.   6.

The automatic payments went well - I was even getting monthly emails notifying me when the statement was available online, which was helpful, since the paper statements were going to my Mother c/o of my brother 's address back XXXX. My Mom died in XXXX of XXXX, and mail then was presumably sent to my brother. Since he had no further interest in that Wells Fargo checking account after her death, he did n't bother opening the statements, if he even got them - I was checking the account online, and all was well - or so I thought - I had sufficient money in that account to pay the monthly LOC payments for a couple of years, in fact, it was on my calendar to replenish it this year.  My brother and I were busy trying to settle my Mom 's complicated estate from a distance - he was having to deal with matters XXXX, where she owned property, and I was doing what I could from here XXXX. I was distracted and did n't notice when I stopped getting the emails reminding me to check the account online until I got an email from WF XXXX/XXXX/XXXX, informing me that the monthly automatic payment had bounced! I went immediately to the local Wells Fargo and it turned out that at some point ( perhaps when the email notifications stopped coming?! ) the account had gotten below a certain threshold and I was being charged a hefty monthly service charge, which had caused the account to be depleted faster than expected, there was only about {$80.00} left in the account and my monthly {$100.00} automatic payment bounced. My brother and I decided to close the XXXX checking account, and I decided to bring the LOC to zero, so I asked the banker for the payoff amount. She made a phone call, and I was given the amount, wrote a check on my personal checking account, took the remaining cash from the closed checking account, and thought I was done with the matter until I could close the LOC ( to close it now will cost me {$400.00} ).

7195,"I have been a member of Pentagon Federal Credit Union ( PENFED ) since 1999. During my tenure at the Penfed, I have often been offered many products and services ( i.e. Credit Cards ) ; but, each time I have applied I have been denied. As time went on, I began to notice a pattern and came to suspect blatant discrimination and began to challenge their quick denials. Four times I was turned down for a mere personal loan of XXXX before finally being approved after having to provide a number of documents, complain to the board, and speaking to high level managers. The loan was PAID IN FULL on time and early. Yet, when I asked for an additional loan, I was promptly denied. Yet, I began noticing how they would cater to the Latinos and Hispanics who were n't even born in this country, yet were able to get loans and anything else. Recently, I have also been noticing that PenFed is now starting to advertise : 'Great Rates for Everyone '. Yet, if this be true, then why do I continue to be denied products and services? Most recently, I was denied a car loan having been told : 'You have never had a loan like this before. ' What? Presumably, they were referring to an installment loan whereby, I had one from PenFed and a Student Loan. Prior to this, I was denied the {$500.00} Credit Protection on my Checking Account and then scolded when my account was depleted. If that were n't enough at one point, they serendipitously removed funds from my Savings into the Checking account in an futile attempt to bring the account current. I needed to stop a payment on a check whereby I was charged a fee. Unbeknownst to me, this fee could have been avoided if I had initiated the stop payment online. I was n't made aware of this until I called and was attempting to stop payment on another check. Much to my chagrin, I was not at all pleased. Truth is, I have been extremely unhappy and frustrated with PenFed for quite awhile because it is my firm belief and despite their denials, that I have been discriminated against and continues to this day. In terms of the car loan, I was expecting to take advantage of the low rates offered by Credit Unjons. Yet, as previously mentioned, I was denied. I did receive a car loan for the XXXX I had requested from PenFed ; but, at a much higher interest rate than is necessary. I also recently received a new XXXX Card. Hence, why am I not able to take advantage of all the products and services that as a member of this Credit Union offers? At this time, I am looking to refinance my vehicle ; but, extremely apprehensive about even applying due solely in part to the continued maltreatment. It is extremely frustrating to be a member of a Credit Union only to seek products and services outside of the CU in order to prove my credit worthiness before you will even consider taking a chance on me. That in itself is blatant discrimination because I have been told in the past that it is best that I find another creditor to take a chance before we do. Also, it is annoying to constantly hear how conservative they are. This fact is abundantly clear. It should be known that I initially took my concerns to NCUA whereby I have been referred to this agency for further assistance. ",zeng60@purdue.edu,0

Regardless of the excuses the bank has used to deny my claim, I contend that I did not perform those transactions, neither anyone I know. I was a victim of fraud, and the Bank does not want to take responsibility and give me the stolen money from my debit card/checking account. I am a full time worker, and a part-time student.

I reiterated, as I had emphasized to her escalation manager, that I prefer communication by email or PNC 's Secure Message Center. She said those options are not possible, despite the fact that communication to date about my dispute had in fact been via email and the PNC 's Secure Message Center. She said electronic communication is not  secure '' enough. Surprised, I asked,  so PNC 's Secure Message Center is not actually secure? '' All she could say was escalation reps are not allowed to communicate in writing. PNC clearly does not want any written record of the errors it is making on my account and false promises it makes to consumers, and it continues to drag its feet on posting the promotional bonus that indisputably applies. This appears to be PNC 's pattern and practice, and PNC appears to be waiting for me to submit a complaint to the CFPB before correcting my account. Thank goodness for CFPB and its Complaint Portal, but PNC should not get to evade scrutiny by simply correcting their errors once individual consumers complain. This foot-dragging practice allows the bank to hold consumers ' money and profit from the interest  float, '' when the funds should already be in consumer 's accounts, earning interest for the consumer, not PNC.

Then clears the money verifies the check and then that money goes to the receivers account. Once there it stays on hold while that bank uses that money to make money before allowing it to show up in the account. In my mind and in my belief that is laundering. Using XXXX of consumers money to make XXXX worth of interest between banks. In that I think it is possible that just like the mortgage industry bubble popped eventually this will also be a bubble that pops.

Bank of America responded to you and to me ( letter attached ) but failed to address or resolve the issues I brought to your attention. I was reported to XXXX and to XXXX XXXX XXXX for an account that was closed due to a check I deposited that was returned on a closed account. It caused my account to go negative. As a college student, I did not have the funds to pay it off right away but did pay it a year later in full. I tried to get the this removed from my record with XXXX by writing to the bank and explaining that the check was written to me and I had no way of knowing it would be returned. The response I got was that it was something other than that check. In chexsystems I was reported for  suspected fraud activity '' and in XXXX I was reported for  Transacting ( or attempting to transact ) with an account in an unauthorized or prohibited manner ''. I tried repeatedly to get information from the bank as to what I did that made them suspect  fraud '' and I have never been able to get an answer. I have done nothing fraudulent! I have not benefited in any way from the deposit of a bad check that I had no way of knowing would be returned. I took responsibility and paid it in full so the bank has not suffered any losses as a result of what happened. I on the other hand have been unable to open an account at any bank and have  fraud '' associated with my name which is unacceptable.  The response to my first complaint mentioned nothing about the reason they reported to XXXX or XXXX. In fact the letter I received says they  investigated '' my complaint and found that my checking and savings account were closed due to me depositing a check that was returned. It says my account was closed for non-sufficient funds  activity '' or unsatisfactory handling and then goes on to say that the report they filed with XXXX and ews was accurate and will not remove it. It makes no mention of any  suspected fraud '' or any  attempted transacting '' with another account. It does not explain in way why I was reported for those reasons. To be reported for non-sufficient funds is VERY different from being reported for  fraud ''. The implications are extremely serious.  I would like for them to explain to me what I did that could be construed as fraudulent and also prove to me that I intended to commit fraud. If they can not do this, then I am demanding that they remove the damaging record from my name in XXXX and in XXXX. It is critical to me that I clear this from my name. I feel as though I have been accused of criminal activity and then convicted of it without ever getting to hear any evidence and then not being allowed to respond to it. It is unfair and wrong. I am attaching a copy of the letter I received from BofA in response to my original complaint and a copy of the XXXX and XXXX report so that you may review it as well.   Thank You ",meng46@purdue.edu,1
7471,"I got an following email from Citibank about a promotional offer where-in if I open a citigold account with the promotion code : XXXX and then meet the following requirements, then I 'll be getting the XXXX American Bonus miles after 90 days ( starting from the last statement after the requirements are met ) Requirements : 1.

I met both the requirements in XX/XX/2016, then I waited for the statement generated on XXXX XXXX 2016. After that I waited till 90 days ( 3 statements ) i.e the statement generated on XXXX XXXX 2016, still i have n't ' got the XXXX miles.

Waited for next month statement as well on XXXX XXXX 2016 which was delayed by 2 days and I finally got it on XXXX XXXX 2016, still no miles.   This is same scenario with couple of my friends as well.   So I was left with no other choice, but to raise a complaint against these cheaters who make false promises just to attract customers in the beginning and then they never fulfill their promises.   If I wont get my deserved/earned XXXX American bonus miles, I 'll close my Citibank account and I 'll never open it again.

7477,"I have several accounts with Capital One Bank, so on XXXX/XXXX/16 I went to a Branch location to send an International wire transfer for {$27000.00}. I provided a printed sheet with all the necessary information clearly listed,  the employee filled out the Capital One wire transfer request form. He told the wire would take  up to XXXX business days '', even though every other financial insitution I have used, usually process such wires in only XXXX3 days. I was charged a {$40.00} fee for the transaction. I began contacting the receipient bank on XXXX  continued daily through XXXX, 14 days after initiating the wire transfer, to confirm arrival of the funds, but was told no funds had ever arrived. On XXXX I called the bank  spoke with the Branch Manager, who said he would check  get back to me, which he did not do. I finally went to the Branch on XXXX,  was told that the employee who had handled the original transfer on XXXX, had  failed '' to complete the transaction properly so nothing had been done for 15 days. Capital One simply ignored the fact that a {$27000.00} transfer had even been inititated, let alone remain uncompleted for 15 days,  felt no need to contact the customer. Apparently there are ZERO internal audit controls at Capital One,  their employees are so very poorly trained that they are basically clueless about any function other than accpeting basic deposits. The Branch Manager apologized for the lack of professionalism of the employee who had bungled the original transfer,  asked me to let him  personally '' handle the issue,  he would refund the {$40.00} charge since it was a bank error. I agreed. The Manager was then provided the EXACT SAME information sheet as the XXXX employee,  he filled out a XXXX Capital One wire request form,  again told me it would take  up to10 days ''. The {$27000.00} was then deducted from my account on XXXX. I began checking daily with the recipient bank on XXXX XXXX, but the funds had still not arrived by XXXX XXXX, so I contacted the Branch Manager, who was  absolutely  totally CLUELESS '' about what to do. He kept asking me to  simply wait ''  to  keep checking with the recipient bank ''. When no funds had arrived by XXXX XXXX, I contacted the Branch Manager  told him to return the {$27000.00} to my account,  I would have another bank handled the transaction. In response to my request for a refund, I was told NO refund would be forthcoming  until AFTER the bank initiated a search '', which could, AGAIN,  take up to 10 business days. Over the next 7 days we made REPEATED contacts to the Capital One Branch Manager, but were consistently told to  wait '' while they continued their tracking search. On XXXX XXXX I went online to  again '' check my account  noted that  miraculously '' a deposit of {$26.00}, XXXX had been posted as a deposit to my account on XXXX - 7 days earlier. Capital One apparently, unethically, if not illegally, back-dated a deposit date, because we have email messages from the Branch Manager on XXXX, XXXX  XXXX stating they were still  investigating '' the transaction. I contacted the Branch Manager on XXXX  demanded that the {$660.00} be returned to my account,  he responded that the difference was for a  bank fee '' by the  recipient bank '' due to incorrect information. A complete  total fabrication  lie. The recipient bank NEVER received the funds.And 100 % of the necessary information was provided to Capital One not once, but twice. In addition, I learned that Capital One uses XXXX for their International Transfers. I took the EXACT SAME information sheet to Capital One on XXXX  the funds were received by the recipient bank on XXXX. I am due {$660.00} from Capital One, for a transaction that was NEVER completed, which their Branch Manager has categorically lied about.

7490,"I 'd like Chase Bank to issue a letter of explanation about a forged check on my account. It 's almost comical, but I do need the letter so i can complete the refinance of my mortgage.  In a nutshell : Someone going by the name XXXX forged a check on my account. I alerted Chase and a day later Chase closed my account, and opened a new account in my name.  While Chase apparently automatically forwarded other autopay orders to my new bank account, somehow the autopay for my Chase credit card - and only my Chase credit card - was not forwarded, and I missed two payments. Chase 's credit card division then reported my delinquency unleashing a cascading chain of events, as my credit rating momentarily plummeted and XXXX is now holding up my mortgage refinance until i can supply a letter of explanation from Chase.  Chase refuses, of course to admit they goofed, and refuses even to issue a letter explaining the events that led to the late credit card payments. Meanwhile, my credit score has recovered but XXXX 's mortgage division insists on a letter of explanation from Chase before they will allow me to complete my refinancing.   I am attaching copies of relevant correspondence.   Please ask Chase to issue a brief letter of explanation, noting that a forged check forced the closure of my account and an oversight led to two missed credit card payments. My Chase account has a balance in excess of {$110000.00}, and the credit card bill was in the hundreds.   Many thanks - XXXX XXXX XXXX ",afrances@purdue.edu,1

Next, a telephone payment from XXXX XXXX XXXX I set up posted to account and shown as deducted on XXXX/XXXX/16, in the amount of {$140.00}.

I allowed XXXX XXXX Bank to process a bank account payment of {$50.00} on XXXX/XXXX/16.   But, Wells Fargo said the overdraft is from XXXX XXXX XXXX payment of {$140.00} and charged me a {$35.00} overdraft fee. I looked at the order of transactions and the only logical explanation is that they are re-ordering transactions to justify that, just off the simple chronological order of my transactions it is impossible that payment would cause this overdraft. That is unacceptable!   Before I filled out this What happened? section of my complaint i logged into online banking again to review and I see I have now been charged another {$35.00} overdraft fee for the {$50.00} XXXX XXXX payment.

My current balance is - {$60.00}.   Yesterday, when I decided to submit a complaint it was because they were re-ordering the transactions not in their true order to justify the {$35.00} overdraft fee for my XXXX XXXX XXXX payment. Instead, now I am including the second {$35.00} overdraft fee for the XXXX XXXX payment as they are grossly and blatantly trying to manipulate my account for {$70.00}, I do not appreciate that.   I would never challenge a legitimate fee, and I ca n't believe that Wells Fargo would move my transactions around out-of-order versus the daily balance that they provide me!

In fact, after Wells Fargo denied the deposit of the {$500.00} money order, I was forced to deposit it into another checking account at another institution and I faced no issue whatsoever.   After a few days a bill I tried to pay through my Wells Fargo account was denied. I called in and was told that there was a  hard hold '' on my account because of this {$500.00} money order that Wells Fargo thought was fraudulent. I explained to the rep on the phone that it was real, I had the documentation, and I would like a way to get my account unlocked because I had bills to pay. They were extremely unhelpful and told me the only thing I could do was wait and call back in 48 hours for a resolution.   Well today marked about 72 hours since that call. I called back and was transferred to Loss Prevention and told the same thing - my check was fraudulent ( even though its not ), my account was on a hold, oh and now it might be closed and I would be barred from banking with Wells Fargo ever again.   I have been a customer of Wells Fargo for about 20 years. I had an account opened when I was a pre-teen back when it was known as Wachovia. I have several mortgages through Wells Fargo, and I have been a loyal customer. I have NEVER done anything fraudulent with my account, and I am XXXX certain this money order is not fraudulent. To be told that my account is going to be closed over an incorrect assumption on Wells Fargo 's part is infuriating, and terrible service to be quite honest. I am being treated like a criminal and at risk of having this account ( which I a co-signed on with another person ) closed down. This is the account I use to pay my mortgage from! Why on earth would I deposit a fraudulent check?   I have received no help. For the most part I just want to get in touch with whoever is actually handling this case of mine so I can send them directly the receipt I have to prove this money order is real. I do n't want to sit back and wait and just all of a sudden find out my account is closed, all the while not having access to more than {$5000.00} of MY money.   I want this resolved now.

7614,On XXXX/XXXX/16 I opened a Citigold checking account with an associated offer promising XXXX points ( valued around {$500.00} ) after meeting the promotion terms. I met those criteria and confirmed on XXXX/XXXX/16 via chat with a Citi representative that I had met the criteria. The agent told me to expect the promotional XXXX points to be deposited into my account within 90 days of completing the requirements. After the 90 days had elapsed I contacted Citi to inquire about the promotional Thank You points which had not yet been deposited to my account. Citi responded by claiming there was no promotion associated with my account at the time it was opened. I have a copy of the promotional disclosure when the account was opened and saved the conversation with the Citi agent who confirmed the promotion was associated with my account and that I had completed the terms. It is my belief that Citi has engaged in deceptive marketing practices to lure customers to open the high price ( $ XXXX/month ) Citigold product. I do not believe Citi should be allowed to continue this behavior of attracting customers with promotions and after the customers have fulfilled their terms suddenly refuse to honor the promotion. I very much appreciate any effort to resolve this issue and prevent Citi from continuing this behavior. Thank you. ,wu467@purdue.edu,0

I was informed I would loose my XXXX Debit Card if I switched. I believe this to be unfair as I was n't told about these fees and the reason I chose SunTrust to begin with was the XXXX feature.

7630,"XX/XX/XXXX, I went into my local branch to get assistance with my checking accounts. I explained to the branch manager that I lost my job and my income was reduced from XXXX/yr to unemployment checks of XXXX per week. As a result I made an error and accidentally overdrew my account. This created a snowball effect and several items posted to my account along with the {$35.00} OD fee for each transaction. By the time the dust settled, Bank of America had charged me {$450.00} in OD fees. In tears I asked the manager if I could get some assistance with some of the fees as I have been a long time customer with an excellent track record and XXXX mortgages with BOA. The manager said he was unable to help me and that he would escalate this situation to the  back office '' and try to get me some assistance with refunding the fees. He also advised me to contact customer service to see if they had more authority in this area.  # 1. I contacted customer service via phone and explained my financial circumstances and advised that the {$450.00} in OD fees is equivolent to one of my unemployment checks leaving me with no money to buy groceries or pay my utility bills. The representative placed me on hold and came back to the line stating that the OD fees were not a result of a bank error and that I made the mistakes so therfore the fees are valid and she would not be able to assist me.  # 2. I went back to the branch and spoke directly to the branch manager along with a personal banker and they said :  If thats what customer service stated then there is nothing they can do ''.  # 3. I went back to the branch for a THIRD time and advised that I unknowingly received my last unemployment check on XX/XX/XXXX and all of my automatic bill payments came in because I was expecting a deposit into my account on XXXX XXXX. This time I asked if they could temporarily place a hold or freeze on my account to prevent additional debits and {$35.00} OD fees from accumulating to the point where I will not be able to resolve with no income. ONCE AGAIN, I WAS TOLD THERE IS NOTHING THEY COULD DO FOR ME AND THEY WERE SORRY. The branch manager opened some kind of  case '' that would go to his regional manager as she had the authority to waive some or all of these fees that were greatly hurting me.  # 4. I went back to the branch a FOURTH TIME to find out the status of my case and the branch manager said he was told there is absolutely NOTHING HE COULD DO FOR ME although I have been a customer of BOA for many years and have NEVER asked for assistance with my accounts before now. He stated that it would not hurt BOA to refund the OD fees for me and reward me for being a longstanding customer but BOA does not care about its customers and therefore am only trying to make money off of me in fees.  # 5. At this point, Bank of America has collected or assessed almost {$1000.00} in Overdraft related fees and charges. They have also refused to place a hold or freeze on the account last week when I requested such.

I am a single mother with a son in college and in need of being able to put food on my table and keep the electricity and water on. I did not plan on getting laid off and I most certainly did not plan to have my unemployment benefits end prematurely. I need every dime I have to support myself and BOA is taking the little money I have left without regard or remorse of the impact to my family.

7657,I bank with PNC bank. I have a issue currently with a few transactions which caused my account to go negative and NSF charges that were imposed. What happened during this situation is as follows. I was out of town and knew there was going to be a charge go thru my account next week. I was aware of this so I was very cautious with my spending. To be extra cautious I made sure that when I made any type of charge to the account I checked the balance before hand to make sure the large charge did not come out before it should have so my account would not go negative. I have been told my the service reps at the bank that the processes were in real time so I took that to mean if there was a balance in the account that it would go in the order of the charge. THIS IS NOT WHAT HAPPENED. Although I checked before each and every charge the large charge I knew was coming ( although a week early as I was afraid of happening ) did end up going thru. Now the problem is all those charges that I double checked for a balance they did not process it the way they said it would. PNC processed the large charge first and then all the other small charges afterwards causing XXXX NSF charges. I called the bank and they once again told me that Everything processes in real time. I went back and forth with them and they ended up telling me the balance is just a tool. I was not satisfied with this and the case was elevated to a supervisor. I then received a phone call a few days later and the lady told me that things are not processed in real time. This is a stark contast to what I was told in person at the branch as swell as what the online CSR told me. She went on to tell me things are really processed when the receipts are sent to the bank for payments. Well this makes things impossible to try to fix if there was some type of error on the account. Anyway I feel like the bank was completely dishonest with me on how to try and protect myself against charges. If I would have know in the first place I would have just pulled out cash out of my account and paid with things that way so I did not have several hundred dollars in NSF charges. ,han288@purdue.edu,1

I had doubts about such an easy job, but I thought that if the check was valid it would be safe. So on XXXX/XXXX/16 I deposited a check for {$1800.00} into my bank account, and waited for the money to be available. After the bank showed the money in my account I asumed the check was clear, and it was safe to use the money for the job, so I withdrawaled it and used the money.  On XXXX/XXXX/16 I deposited a XXXX check from the same job, and when I did so the balance of my account was off.  After checking all the transactions from my account I noticed that on XXXX/XXXX/16 there was a transaction of return item for the {$1800.00}, the bank took back the money without any notice. I called them and found out that the check was n't valid. I asked them why did they acredited the money if it was n't valid and they said that they trusted me with handing them a valid check.  This is not a matter of trusting their clients, it is their job and responsability to clear the checks before putting the money into people 's accounts making them believe that their checks are valid, and they could use the money.  I withdrawaled {$1600.00} to do the assignment, because I believed that if the money was already in my account that meaned it was real and I had a job to perform as secret shopper.  Bank of America failed in doing their job, which is protecting their customer 's money, and now after they realized that the check that I deposited was n't valid they just removed the money from my account, and told me it is my responsability to verify the checks.

7666,"Dear CPFB, At this point I feel as though I have no other choice than to involve a third party in order to get Citibank to cooperate with me and listen to my valid complaints. First and foremost, I have what was supposed to be a free checking account that I 've held for almost fifteen years without incident, but now almost never use. There appears to be many fees from Citibank attached to this so-called free checking account that I do not understand. Furthermore, when the account for some reason despite almost never being used became overdrawn, perhaps in part due to these mystery fees from Citibank, Citibank did NOT notify me. Instead, they allowed my overdraft account to become totally exhausted, in order to charge me additional interest and fees on the account, that much is clear, but rather than call me when this occurred, they sent me a letter which looked like an ordinary statement rather than call me. Citibank has claimed in said letter that they no longer have my contact information, even though none of it has changed in over ten years. This is either false on the part of Citibank, or it shows extreme incompetence in terms of their record keeping.   The most egregious part, is that even though I sent a certified letter to my branch begging them to please call me to answer my questions, they have ignored my request and instead reported my as DELINQUENT to the major credit bureaus. Without one phone call, and I have banked there for almost 15 years!

This should not be allowed to happen. They should be investigated and they should provide me with the answers I am seeking. I can only wonder how many others may be getting treated like this by a major financial institution who seems to think they have no accountability whatsoever to their customers.

I provided him with the required documentation and after he reviewed it and made calculations he provided me with a conditional approval letter. At that time, he stated that I could start looking for properties and could submit offers ; as I would be looked as a serious buyer with the letter he provided me with. Approximately a week later, I found a condo I liked, but it required a higher amount than what the conditional pre-approval letter stated. I visited him again to sign additional documentation and I inquired about the possibility of increasing my loan. He stated that I could increase my loan amount by {$10000.00}. A day or two later he contacted me and told me that I should stick with the parameters set during the time that he gave me the conditional approval letter. He wished me luck and said that once I found a property the loan was going to be processed quickly as everything was in line. I proceeded to look for a property that fit the parameters he had given me. On Saturday, XXXX/XXXX/2016, I had my agent submit an offer on an ideal property. After consideration from the seller, who received six offers, my offer was accepted. Approximately an hour before I received the news that my offer was accepted on XXXX/XXXX/2016, the loan officer called me to tell me that the loan amount he had originally pre-qualified me for was not applicable. After several frustrating calls, I decided to take time off from work and make an appointment to see him the next day, as I needed to make a deposit so that escrow could open on the house. During this meeting, the loan officer said that information had come in after reviewing my tax returns and it caused my monthly income to be lowered, thus putting me above the debt to income ratio. However, even with this information, he continued to provide me with false hope. He told me that he was going to do what ever he could to resolve this issue. He also suggested that if he could not fix the issue, I could provide an additional {$10000.00} to the {$40000.00} down-payment and it would lower my debt to income ration below the 43 % ratio. As a buyer, I told him that I could n't provide {$10000.00} out of thin air. I left his office and was to expect a call from him before noon. At XXXX I called him and he said that he got his superiors to look into my file. Once again, he provided me with false hope as he said that their decision to even look at my file was a good indicator of potentially approving my loan. He told me he would call me by XXXX with a final decision. During this time, I proceeded to ask my friends for a loan in case it was necessary. I managed to secure a {$10000.00} loan from one of my friends. When he called at XXXX he stated that it was impossible to approve the loan as is. I then told him that I could provide the additional {$10000.00} on top of the down-payment. At this time he said that that was not a possibility. I was baffled as he had just told me that earlier. He stated that I misunderstood and that in order to get the loan I needed, I would have to put down {$80000.00}. As a result, I lost the house I was so excited to purchase. Being a first time home buyer is an already difficult time, but Bank of America 's mortgage loan officer made this experience a complete nightmare. If he had been honest and realistic with his information, I would have never been put in such a predicament.

They told me that XXXX set of checks had cleared, with {$4400.00} being withdrawn from my account and the other set had not cleared.

Later, I saw my statement and saw that all XXXX checks had cleared so that {$8800.00} was withdrawn from my account. I called Wells Fargo twice : the first time the person handling my call for a long time while she talked to her supervisor and told me that they would get back to me. They did not get back to me. I initiated a second call and again I was put on hold a long time while a supervisor was involved and they told me that they were n't going to put the money back in my account ; I should ask the contractor to return the duplicate money. Later, they sent me a letter suggesting that I ask the contractor to return the money. We have had exhaustive talks with the contractor. He had not finished done any more of the job ( front porch ). He did give us {$1000.00} back, but no more. It has been almost two months. I little hope that CFPB can make the contractor do the work.

Most other companies I have dealt with generally offer a reference number after a customer call, together with a representative id number, so that the issue can be traced back if not resolved adequately.  Citibank 's process for resolving customer matters requiring follow up are either severely deficient out of organizational incompetence, or more cynically, purposely designed to avoid leaving an accountability trail that could lead to regulatory actions.  I believe that this matter deserves your attention as it is clearly abusive of the banks customers, as well as possibly abusive of the regulatory process, by designing a system that results in the hiding of these types of issues from regulatory oversight.

The senior banker in the branch advised me that it had not yet  hard posted '' so at this time, there was nothing she could do to stop it. I explained to her, in detail, that I have XXXX accounts : XXXX  catch '' account that all incoming money is transferred into, XXXX  bill pay '' account that all debits come out of and XXXX  holding '' account for the rest. I advised her, in no uncertain terms, that this unauthorized transaction would kick off a domino effect of madness across my other accounts because of transactions that I did authorized and could not stop from now coming through. I advised her that I could n't transfer funds into the bank via ACH until this was resolved because it would require an additional {$400.00} to bring that  catch '' account back from negative, on top of anything needed to cover my other transactions.   She advised me to wait until the unauthorized transaction  hard posted '' and that she could then issue a credit memo immediately to stop the bleed. The following day, when the transaction did hard post, she then informed me that a credit memo would need to wait until Monday - XXXX XXXX. The credit memo was never issued so on Wednesday, XXXX XXXX, I transferred just enough to bring the account back to XXXX and stick a bandaid on the bullet hole. Meanwhile, my accounts had been charged XXXX overdraft fees at {$35.00} each ( {$240.00} ) between the catch account ( where the unauthorized transaction came through and the only one I can electronically transfer funds into ) and the bill pay account ( where all debits are typically made ). On XXXX XXXX, XXXX of those fees were credited back and I was additionally charged a {$30.00} sustained overdraft fee.   I waited an additional week with no form of follow up from the bank for the unauthorized ACH to be reversed. When I followed up with the senior banker on XXXX XXXX, she said she was under the impression that it was resolved because she saw the deposit that I had made on XXXX XXXX. When I informed her that she was wrong, I was not credited and I had personally made another deposit, she called the ACH department to check the status of the claim. She then informs me that they closed the case without a credit after seeing my deposit assuming that it was taken care of. That assumption and lack of communication was an egregious bank error.   I was finally credited for the transaction on XXXX XXXX and XXXX of the additional overdraft fees, as well as the sustained overdraft fee ( {$100.00} ), were credited. This leaves a remaining amount of {$470.00} total additional fees across my accounts that remain uncredited. The fees were only incurred due to an unauthorized transaction, failure to act as promised by the senior banker, lack of communication by the ACH department and failure to properly advise me to even have a chance to stop the spiraling of these accounts.

I requested and completed paperwork for my checking, savings, and credit cards to be converted to Military accounts. This conversion would have given me specific benefits that save me a lot of money while over seas and banking. Over the many years that have past, I continued using my bank of America products, such as my debit card. As a loyal member, I never second guessed the bank. I simply did n't have the time to check on my statements and was preoccupied with other important issues, within the Military. Worrying about my bank statements was the last thing on my mind.

I noticed there were so many fees. There were maintenance fees, International Transaction fees, ATM fees from over seas, overdraft protection fees, and it almost seemed as if there were fees for having too many fees. I called the bank and requested my account be closed, after 11 years of membership. I was told by the representative that my account had never been processed to reflect it was a Military account. This failure to complete that process, meant that I did n't receive the benefits of a Military account. The representative quickly reimbursed me for maintenance fees for this month only. I was informed that I should not have been subject to any fees, specifically maintenance fees of unknown amounts ( as the fee price has fluctuated over my tenure as a member ) and transaction fees, as well. Not to mention, she stated that ATM fees should have been waived too. She quickly transferred me to the Military Department. The new representative agreed that the Military accounts have specific benefits which civilian accounts do n't share. But, unlike the first representative he refused to tell me what those benefits might be. Instead, he asked me to wait a few days, while they reviewed the account to determine which benefits they will approve for me.

This is such a rip off, their customer service representatives take no action towards this ( and apparently are not allowed to ) and honestly as petty as this sounds I am flabbergasted at how much this institution 's restrictions and process prove to be incompetent at times. If you know that your bank processes weekend charges much later than other banks then you also should delay on charging overdraft fees instead of ruining people 's financial planning.

In XX/XX/2016, I submitted an application for a Citigold bank account using promo code XXXX which I had received from Citibank.

After I met the promotion requirements, I contacted via phone and chat to Citibank to confirm this and to inquire when to expect the points to be posted. I was told that my request would be researched. Finally they informed me that there was no AAdvantage miles promotion offered in conjunction with the opening of my account. This letter contradicts all discussions I had with Citi at the time I opened the account and at activation. I would not have opened the bank account with Citibank if it was not for this promotion. I am requesting Citi to honor the set promotion. If I was indeed not targeted for the promotion, Citi should have rejected my application for opening the new account using the promo code. And not reject it when I have opened the account, met all the necessary requirements and when it comes time to pay out the bonus. They have not acknowledged that if I was not going to receive a bonus it should have been communicated to me during numerous confirmations about the offer. In addition to that they have been charging $ XXXX/month as account maintenance fee on my account.   It has been weeks of dealing with this and I am very disappointed that Citi would mislead and treat their customers in this manner.

Second I entered the promotional code from the promotional flyer when applying for my Citigold checking account.  My account was approved and the Citigold new account servicing team informed me ( during the account activation process ) that I will receive the Promotional incentive after I meet the terms during the account reviewing/activation process.

I received the same letter last year from XXXX XXXX in Client Services, but was able to overturn the decision based on the fact they KNEW me and their issue at the time was incoming wire transfers from XXXX XXXX. I explained that I obtained a job in XXXX XXXX as a XXXX. I was simply transferring part of my salary, once a month, to SunTrust. It was black and white and I told them I could send them my employment letter and proof of income, if needed. A week later, they stated all was well and that my accounts would remain open.   Now, one year later, I received the same account closing letter.   My father wired in {$200000.00} from abroad 3 months ago. My father XXXX and I let SunTrust know the wire was incoming and contacted the branch manager to make sure she was aware and also to let me know if there were any forms or documentation they needed from me.   At that point, the branch manager stated all was well and convinced me to open a money market account to keep part of the money in, which I did. She also stated I should use my checking account more often since SunTrust is such a convenient bank, which I ALSO did. I routed some of my business direct deposits through the account ( since I was a sole proprietor and the business was simply in my name, she stated that would be okay ).

8157,"On XXXX XXXX, 2016, my cousin, opened XXXX accounts at the XXXX XXXX in XXXX XXXX, CA. The first account was a sole ownership account for herself to be used as her vacation spending money and the second was a joint account with me as the primary account holder and her as the secondary joint owner for the purpose of buying property together. On XXXX XXXX, 2016, XXXX wire transferred her personal funds from her account in XXXX to support our real estate venture together. The funds cleared with no issues. However, she came to the conclusion that it was unnecessary for her to have a sole owner account for vacation money as the majority of the funds were to be used to buy property. She transferred her money from her sole account to her joint account online and made an online request to have her sole account closed. The sole account was ended up closed but her funds in the joint account were now frozen with a pledge.  Since I am a primary owner on the joint account, I contacted customer service regarding the issue. They explained that they could not speak with me, only my cousin, even though I was on the account. I called the branch where we opened the account to get help from the banker, however, she was was out sick fro almost a week and no one in that branch could help me. During that time, I reached out to my local branch, XXXX XXXX XXXX, where the staff and Service Manager tried calling customer service internally. They were directed to Loss Prevention where they were told that they would not speak to me, only my cousin, and to have her call the number on the screen which was ( XXXX ) XXXX. Being that she was back home in the XXXX from her vacation, I relayed the information for her to call the number provided. She called the number several times and identified herself but was not offered any help with resolution. She was told that the only way for the pledge to be released was for her to travel back to the XXXX and walk into any Wells Fargo Branch to identify herself. She explained that she was pregnant and was past the permissible period to fly while pregnant. She offered to identify herself at any of the Wells Fargo investment branches in the XXXX but was denied.   When the banker, came back to work, she contacted my wife and asked for her to take a trip to the XXXX XXXX. She claimed that it would be better for us to call the number together. My wife explained that we had already tried that route from home and at the XXXX XXXX branch with no success because no one is willing to speak with my husband. The banker pressed for us to come but when my wife would not agree, she proceeded to confess to her that she made a mistake by calling the XXXX number earlier in the morning and lying that XXXX was in front of her. She explained that agent was surprised to know that my cousin was back in the XXXX and asked to speak with her. The banker then changed her story for the agent, claiming that XXXX went home and that she had me there. The agent suspected she was not being truthful and did not continue. She then called my wife and pressed for us to come out to XXXX XXXX to call together so that my wife could pose as my cousin. My wife was completely astounded and refused her offer.  This situation has been ongoing since. I understand that there are heightened security measures for legitimate reasons. As mentioned earlier, my wife managed at Wells Fargo for 10 years. I have no issues with security measures but this situation and lack of resolution is unacceptable. The fact that a banker lied and potentially made our situation worse is not acceptable. We have tried everything we could at the branch level with no success. The resolution team did nothing for us. I called the corporate office only to be given the same information and no alternative resolution options. ",zhu488@purdue.edu,0

8166,"Deposits made at Ally are stated to be available as first {$200.00} next business day and the rest after. Regularly, I make deposits on the weekends. The availability notification ( email ) is not sent until Tuesday morning. Usually this email says some is available Tuesday ( although this is actually 2 business days ). This case had about {$700.00} ( XXXX checks ) deposited Sunday morning. Assuming they would at least be partially available Tuesday, I scheduled bill payments for Tuesday and Wednesday. I received an email Tuesday morning that multiple overdrafts occurred. Then I got an email that my deposit checks would be held for XXXX5 business days from this Tuesday. I called and they said in fact 5 business days from Tuesday, meaning that I made the deposit on XXXX and it would be available XXXX. The reasoning is  too many overdrafts ''.   My issue is that 1 ) I was as never notified that I 've had  too many overdrafts '' and fell into this category. It has never been this way. I have never had a bounced check. How many is  too many ''? Why 5 days instead of XXXX, in XXXX? Why 5 days from Tuesday, not the day the deposit as made? If the deposit availability was clearer, I would never have overdrafts but this cycle just continues.  2 ) the bank should notify me, at the latest, Monday, for a Sunday deposit if there will be a hold l, so that I can not schedule bill payments. This would prevent these overdrafts 3 ) the reason this check is on hold ( overdrafts ) is causing more overdrafts and thus continuing the cycle.  4 ) with this very long hold, there will likely be an overdraft every single day from now until the money is available. A {$25.00} fee each day for the next XXXX8 days, plus the returned payments from the loans/creditors. It will end up costing me more in fees than the original deposit and in the end I will again be negative and overdrafted from the fees, even after the deposits are made available.  All of this could have been prevented and been more fair if the bank had notified me that either my account was in this situation where desposits would be held or notified me in the first 24 hours of making the deposit that this would be the situation. Neither was done, and I assume it was in order to capitalize on the massive fees.  This entire practice is so very unfair. It is my money being held so long and at the bank 's discretion, which they deceptively practice. It continues the cycle of massive overdraft fees and making the bills I try to pay bounce.   This bank also practices processing all outgoing payments prior to all deposits for each day which maximizes their overdraft potential. This has left me with a positive balance for a day even though I ended up with overdraft fees. Again, very deceptive and maximizing these fees, in addition to putting me into an unnecessary category of  too many overdrafts ''. ",gupta362@purdue.edu,0

8220,"This is in response to Case number : XXXX. See bottom for original response.   First, let 's talk credit reporting in general. You are not obligated to report to the bureaus. You are only obligated to report correctly, if you choose to report at all. You most certainly have the legal ability to DELETE the negative reporting. I did not ask you to report it as CURRENT. I asked you to DELETE it.  Second, I asked you to delete it because it was caused by unfair confusion created by your company/products/website and terrible customer service ( no branched, impossible call center, etc. ).  Third, the sole purpose of reporting to the bureaus is to record a debtors commitment and capacity to repay their debts. This single event does not accurately reflect my commitment and ability to repay my debts. Let 's be honest, this is n't even a real debt. This is some horrible overdraft  projection '' on MY checking/savings accounts. This is n't a mortgage ( mine 's current ). This is n't a car payment ( mine 's current ). This is n't a credit card ( mine 's current and with you ... most likely not for long. ). This is n't any other form of consumer loan.  I appreciate you sending me a copy of an electronic statement. Please review the full history of my relationship with your organization. Any other flaws? Any late payments? Of course not. This was an isolated mistake on a horrible product you tied to my bank account. Seems like someone would have called me, emailed me, knocked on my door ... anything.  Again, I 'm requesting this single isolated transaction to be DELETED. Not misreported as Current. This is simple.    Citibank N.A . said : Explanation of closure I understand that you recently requested that the derogatory information reported by Citibank to its subscribing credit reporting agencies for your ( now ) closed Checking Plus account number ending in XXXX, be removed from your credit report. Your prior attempts to have this particular account updated by Citibank have been declined.  XXXX XXXX, it is the responsibility of the Bank to report that which is true and accurate to the credit reporting agencies. Please be assured that Citibank has researched this matter thoroughly and could find no errors in the manner in which your payments were applied to your Checking Plus account. I have also included your monthly statements for XX/XX/XXXX, XX/XX/XXXX, XX/XX/XXXX and XX/XX/XXXX. Our records confirmed that you made a payment on XXXX XXXX, 2015 in the amount of {$430.00}, which was not the full amount billed of {$470.00} as stated in your XX/XX/XXXX statement. No payments were received XX/XX/XXXX and XX/XX/XXXX, which resulted in a late charge being assessed to your account in the amount of {$11.00} on XXXX XXXX, 2015. Final payment of the overdue amount of {$48.00} was received on XXXX XXXX, 2015 and your Checking Plus account was closed. It is for this reason that Citibank is not able to remove the past due reporting on the credit report.  I realize that this is not the outcome for which you were hoping, however, it is one with which we can not change our position. Thank you for allowing us the opportunity to respond to your concerns.

8240,"To whom this may concern, I am in a bit of a unique situation that has severely limited my access to financial services and I am writing this complaint in hopes that a solution can be reached.   By way of background, here is the problem : I am currently located in XXXX but receive physical checks from my freelancing work. These physical checks are delivered to my US address, XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX XXXX, California, XXXX because international mail is both expensive and inconsistent. While I previously had these checks sent to directly to my US bank account, my bank decided, for unknown reasons to close my bank account. As a result, I have been unable to cash about 6 months worth of checks and have been having significant financial troubles. While I could resolve this situation by traveling back to the US and opening up another bank account I am prohibited from doing so because of the associated cost. Despite having over one thousand dollars in soon-to-be stale checks in the US, I am unable to access any of the monies from those checks.   I am writing this complaint in hopes that Chase Bank will provide me with a detailed response on how I can get those checks cashed and gain access to the monies. Thus far I have tried : 1. ) Giving my mother, who is receiving the checks at my former US address, a Durable Power Of Attorney. The bank refused to honor this Power Of Attorney despite it being fully signed and executed. The bank states that I must have the Power Of Attorney notarized, however, XXXX is not a signatory to the XXXX and thus is not allowed to do international notarization. At the same time, the US Consulate provides notarization services but traveling to and from the US Consulate and paying the notarization fee is beyond my financial means.  2. ) Other means such as sending the checks to XXXX, signing the checks, then sending them back to the US and then having my mother deposit the now endorsed check. It works but because of the shipping times involved, some of the checks become stale dated and expired, thus limiting my ability to gain access to my funds. On top of this, the additional shipping costs are unreasonable for small dollar checks.   In review of the California Statutes regarding notarization as listed here : XXXX, I would like to inquire if the bank with allow a signed power of attorney with XXXX witness signatures, in accord with Section 4122. Please promptly advise and I will have a Power Of Attorney signed with XXXX signatures made available to the bank for review.

8342,"I submitted a complaint to you around XXXX XXXX, but for whatever reason, I do n't think it made it to you as I have not yet received a confirmation email. This is what was submitted : There were XXXX unauthorized ACH withdrawals from my checking account this past XXXX XXXX and XXXX XXXX. I notified my bank after this first group of XXXX unauthorized withdrawals and told them to block any ACH withdrawals from this person. They assured me this was done and refunded my account the XXXX unauthorized ACH withdrawal amounts, without explaining how or why this happened. Thankfully, the amount of the first set of withdrawals was relatively small ( under {$300.00} ). This past month I noticed XXXX more unauthorized withdrawals ( totaling {$390.00} ) and after doing research, I found they were from the same individual as the XX/XX/XXXX/XX/XX/XXXX withdrawals. I again notified my bank on XXXX XXXX. On XXXX XXXX the last of the XXXX ACH withdrawals was refunded. I insisted on an explanation of how they allowed the same individual access to my checking account, after telling them never to allow this person access following the first occurrence in XX/XX/XXXX/XX/XX/XXXX. They said there was an  error '' made and that they assigned my checking account number as this individual 's MEMBER NUMBER and further explained to me, he used this MEMBER NUMBER to set up ACH withdrawals. They also explained their investigation concluded this individual was not committing fraud ( ref USAA response, XXXX XXXX, XXXX ) despite my complaint of fraud by this person. I wrote them back telling them they were totally at fault for assigning my account number as another individual 's  member number '' and this individual should be investigated further. I explained this individual was committing bank fraud because you can not set up ACH withdrawals with MEMBER NUMBERS, just routing and bank account numbers, and his NAME against my account number should have triggered a fault in the USAA bank security system, and should not have allowed processing of his ACH withdrawals against my account. I have asked many times for an explanation from USAA, only to get bits and pieces and excuses why this happened. Their bottom line solution was to advise me to open another account, which I did on my own anyway. I do not see how opening a new account assures bank account security within USAA, and want to know if USAA Federal Savings Bank can be held liable for damages and failure to provide security of bank funds. Additionally, I feel they are liable for these gross errors in assigning my bank account number ( and who knows how many others ) to another member and then processing ACH withdrawals under mismatched account numbers and account owner names.

8369,"Dear CFPB, I received a call from XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX ( originator ID : XXXX ) from my local US Bank branch, offering me a credit card I was eligible for, which I declined. He also mentioned that I currently had a {$500.00} overdraft protection account, and I could be eligible for a line of credit up to {$5000.00} at a lower interest rate. I told him I was interested and authorized him to proceed with a credit check to determine the amount and terms of my eligibility.  The very next contact I received was a VOICEMAIL from XXXX XXXX, telling me that I have been approved at {$5000.00}, that the account has been set up, that I 'd receive a credit card in the mail ( which is what I clearly did n't want in the first place ) that I could just not use, and that it was at a lower interest rate than my previous overdraft account. This turned out to be 13.5 %, though I was never told that until much later.  A few days later I received a letter from US Bank showing me my XXXX credit score for this loan at XXXX as of XXXX. I found this to be an error, as I keep very close track to my XXXX and XXXX credit scores, XXXX of which have been at XXXX for quite some time and have had absolutely no major changes that would result in a XXXX point swing over the course of 9 days. I logged onto XXXX on XXXX and found my credit score to in fact be XXXX.  Upon contacting the bank about this, XXXX XXXX did in fact verify that he saw my credit score as currently XXXX. I was told by the manager, XXXX XXXX XXXX, that they had it on file as of XXXX at XXXX and there was nothing we could do about it for another 6 months until the next review of my creditworthiness. I called US Bank 's credit services and worked my way XXXX levels up the customer support chain to speak to a very kind gentleman ( XXXX? ) who explained that there is literally not a mechanism in the US Bank system that lets them manually review/adjust someone 's credit score. I was n't asking for anything special, all I wanted was an account with an interest rate based on my credit score. Due to the lack of a mechanism to achieve this, what I had to settle for is to reapply now, get it approved at the correct rate ( which will result in a second inquiry to my credit ).  With that as the backdrop, I have XXXX primary issues that I 'm reporting to the XXXX : -First and foremost, these strike me as incredibly loose and dangerous lending practices, and I can not imagine US Bank would approve of or teach this process. The terms of the line of credit were NEVER discussed or agreed to by me prior to the account being set up, namely the interest rate and the score it was based upon, fees, terms, etc. If it had, I would have said I disagreed with the score at that time and we would n't be here now.  Additionally, as I 've reapplied, I found out that while 13.5 % was in fact lower than the interest rate overdraft protection account it was replacing, but it is also THE HIGHEST POSSIBLE INTEREST RATE YOU COULD HAVE ON THIS CREDIT LINE. This is an absolute slap in the face.  Furthermore, while reapplying for the line of credit, I was asked questions regarding military service and whether I was or related to a senior political figure, both of which are fluid topic. Point being I was not asked about this by the loan originator, and it somehow got processed anyway. I was also shown the terms of the line of credit, including fees, penalties, and a lot of other information any reasonable human being would expect to be reviewed prior to the account actually being set up. I was blown away at how thorough the websites process was, and how XXXX employees appear to be offering credit products in a manner that would be unscrupulous at best, and illegal at worst.  -My second complaint is the fact that US Bank and frankly any financial institution would not have a mechanism in place to manually override these types of issue ",gupta362@purdue.edu,0

This is an in response to US Bank placing what they think is amount owed on an overdrawn checking account in Collections with XXXX XXXX XXXX. The current amount placed in collections is {$700.00}.  The majority if not all of the what US Bank claims is the overdraft amount was caused by OVERDRAFT FEES. What has happened is that on one day the US Bank online site that I can access shows that I have a positive balance with my direct deposit being credited to my account that day. Then I would pay bills and get cash at an ATM. One time I Withdrew Cash from an US Bank location in XXXX, WI. I was given the cash by the drive thru teller. This was a Saturday and then on Monday the deposit date changed to that Monday and I was charged an Over Draft Fee of {$36.00} for that. This scenario has happened numerous times. The Bank Manager ( XXXX XXXX ) at the US Bank XXXX office stated that the teller should not have given me the cash. I am fairly certain that the teller also had seen that my account had a deposit that was credited to my account and then gave me the cash withdrawal.  I am including a Screen Shot of what I saw on the Saturday morning on US Bank 's online site.  I am also including the same Screen Shot with notes on it in red that shows the overdraft fees that were charged while my account was positive. This is the only screen shot I have but this scenario has happened multiple times which is the reason my account became negative {$700.00}. In fact fees were charged twice on checks that were returned NSF and then re-submitted.  If that money is not available it should not say that it is available. Why should I be charged these fees due to US Bank 's faulty website?  I am demanding that the {$700.00} that was placed in collections be zeroed out and be removed from collections. If anything US Bank owes me money for the fees that vendors charged my on returned checks that should not have been returned. ",lin551@purdue.edu,0

Therefore, I owed {$97.00} plus {$25.00} for the late fee in XX/XX/XXXX and only paid {$97.00}.

The demo iron she used worked wonderfully on our hair. She even pointed out how it steamed and it was taking the moisture out of the hair therefore not causing damage. It was supposed to make the hair healthier and not damage it like other irons. I was hesitant at first, but she kept lowering the price and telling me she would give me a GREAT deal. Since the demonstration worked so well I went ahead and purchased the irons. I got home and the next day I washed my hair and used the iron and right away noticed it was nothing close to the one she was using for the demo in the mall. There was no steam and it did n't straighten my hair as fast as the one she used. I went back to the mall and tried to return the products to the merchant and they told me they only would exchange the product for a different one and there were no refunds. Before I bought the irons the return policy was not stated nor was it posted. It was only printed at the bottom of the receipt AFTER I had already purchased it. Red flag right there because most places that sell products will back them up with a guarantee. I explained that I did not want another product that did n't work as advertised.

'' To set your expectations, if all requirements were completed on the statement cycle that will end on XXXX/XXXX/XXXX, then the bonus miles will be credited by XXXX/XXXX/XXXX and will reflect during the month of XXXX XXXX. '' I waited until XXXX XXXX and still had not received the promotional bonus of XXXX XXXX miles to my AAdvantage account. I initiated an inquiry asking why I still had not received my points to which Citi responded stating an investigation had been opened. I have just received the results of Citibank Service request XXXX to which they have stated I am all of a sudden not eligible. This response, in my opinion, indicates Citibank agents knowingly promote false answers to obtain new accounts given the experience I had throughout the application and new account setup process with the multiple confirmations of eligibility and subsequent confirmation of having met the requirements XX/XX/XXXX only to deny this promotion after the fact.  I would like Citibank to honor their promise of the XXXX XXXX miles to my AAdvantage account or I will be forced to shut down this account as I certainly can not bank with an entity that I have now lost trust and faith in their verbal and written words.   Thank you for your time and assisting in these matters. ",john1300@purdue.edu,0

8480,"The bank is USAA Federal Savings Bank. I have been a customer for over 12 years. The bank allowed access to my checking, savings, and insurance accounts. Within minutes someone had taken a little over {$800.00} out of my accounts. I received notification via email that my car insurance id was ready to access as well as a quote for car insurance. I had not called the bank to do these actions. So I then called the bank but could not access the automated information due to it not recognizing my zip code or other personal identifiers previously in place. When I spoke to a representative I was told the account would not have the changes take effect to the insurance and it seems as someone called in as me. I was travelling so I ended the call but attempted to check my mobile app to determine if my bank account was touched, I was able to access via the app at first and found that there had been transfers from my savings and another checking account into a main account at the bank that I had not authorized. I immediately called the bank back again and after a 30 minute wait to speak to a representative was disconnected during a transfer to security. I had to call back again and waited approximately 30 more minutes to speak to someone again. I advised them that I did not authorize any change, transfers, or withdrawals other than a gas purchase and food purchases not over {$10.00} and wanted to file an unauthorized access to the account. When I advised them that I was travelling for the holiday and I needed my funds, not to let anyone take the money they advised they would allow me to get to an ATM to withdrawal funds. However, my card did not work with the PIN and then I was told the money I saw minutes ago on the app was no longer there because of a XXXX Transfer. I had not authorized a XXXX transfer I had been on the phone within minutes of the unauthorized access due to the account alert from the insurance access. I was stranded during my travels and told it would take 3 - 5 business days before I could access the money or get anything back.

I met the requirements in XX/XX/XXXX, as confirmed via email with a Citi representative, and was advised miles would post by XXXX/XXXX/XXXX. I also provided my XXXX account number to Citi via email so they would be able to credit the miles and received notification back specific to this promotion that the account number had been added. When the miles had not posted a few days after the XXXX XXXX statement, now more than 90 days from meeting requirements, I submitted an inquiry and was given the response that although I had been advised that I had the promotion on the account, that I was not eligible for the promotion.

8488,"On XXXX XXXX 2016, I informed M  T Banking that there were several fraud charges on my account from an XXXX customer. These transactions were noted by me on XXXX/XXXX/16 and was reported on XXXX/XXXX/16. However, M  T Bank stated they would investigate the matter and informed me that they would give my money back in a few days.  Five days later, on XXXX/XXXX/16, M  T Bank deposited the stolen money back into my account with the exception of XXXX transaction. I was informed they could not stop the other transactions from going through therefore they credited my account. When they credited my account I assumed it was the money that was illegally taken from my account on XXXX/XXXX/16 and thought nothing of it.  On XXXX XXXX, I received a letter stating that M  T was going to reverse the credit and pull all funds from my account on XXXX/XXXX/16. I asked M  T Bank  Why was this draft or reverse credit taking place? '' They informed me that they never paid the illegal transactions that took place on XXXX/XXXX/16 because they did not receive the required paperwork from the third party. I then asked  If they never paid then why did they credit my account XXXX/XXXX/16? When I viewed my account on the XXXX, it clearly showed the transactions taking place ... this is the VERY reason I called them in the first place. However, when I viewed the account documents, the account showed no evidence of any illegal charges taken place on the XXXX. As a matter of fact the only transactions relevant to this issue noted was the credit on XXXX/XXXX/16 M  T had placed in my account. The problem with this is, if you see the credit on the account, XXXX would most likely ask why is there a credit? M  T could not tell me exactly why the charges fell off the monthly statements which would have have shown why the credit was on XXXX/XXXX/16. I then proceeded to ask why did you credit my account on the XXXX of XXXX for activity that did n't take place on the XXXX/XXXX/16? I told the bank  if you did not pay the charges on the XXXX/XXXX/16, then why the heck did you give me a credit making me think you were simply reimbursing me like you said you would on XXXX/XXXX/16? Now you want to reverse the credit back to M  T on XX/XX/XXXX/2016.This has caused total confusion and obviously documents have been changed or loss to benefit M  T XXXX I do n't understand why it would take 5 days to determine if you are going to pay a transaction or not. Yet on the 5th day and 5 days later you give me the same dollar amount which was originally illegally taken on XXXX XXXX! ( see amount below ) : For the record I called M  T on XXXX  XXXX XXXX and XXXX XXXX and tried to solve the problem. The M  T letter I received was dated XXXX XXXX, 2016. The # is XXXX. Each time I called and spoke to several employees the response was unacceptable. The last person I spoke with was XXXX who identified himself as 'XXXX the Manager '.  Because of these transactions being reversed, this has caused undue stress on my entire family and home expenses. Transactions : All illegally withdrawn on XXXX/XXXX/2016 : {$510.00}, {$510.00}, {$510.00}, {$70.00}. The total amount M  T will reverse are the same numbers and amounts above.  XXXX : Why did M  T credit my account on XXXX XXXX, 2016, when they did not pay the transactions on XXXX XXXX, XXXX? The bank could have just not did anything because I would of not have lost any money, that is, if they did not pull it from my account-right? It looks to me like I am being forced to pay for the illegally transactions, not caused by me, out of my pocket by allowing M  T to revere the credit. Also M  T could not and would not show that the illegal transactions on XXXX/XXXX/16 were not paid which is suspicious banking activity to me. All documents should available for view.

8649,"I am the victim of a fraud. The scheme is as follows. I was contacted by someone from XXXX with a request to take care of a pet. The person sent me a check, which I deposited in my Bank of America checking account. Once the check cleared, I deposited the amount into another Bank of America account as instructed by the fraudster ( minus my fee for the services ). As I was suspicious of this, I waited until the check cleared ( on the very next day ) before I deposited the cash ( minus the advance payment for the services I provided ) to a fictitious pet store for food and other pet care.  Here are the details : On XXXX/XXXX/2016, I received a check for {$2900.00} and I deposited it the same day at the local Bank of America branch in XXXX XXXX, CA. The check cleared the next day ( XXXX/XXXX/2016 ) and I withdrew {$2600.00} and deposited that amount to another Bank of America bank account. On XXXX/XXXX/2016 the check for {$2900.00} bounced back and the same amount of money was withdrawn from my account. I called the bank ( spoke to XXXX XXXX ) and they told me to contact the fraud department. I asked the fraud department why the fraudulent check cleared the next day, while other checks take at least a couple of days to clear. She said the reason was I had been a loyal customer and had been given access to the money prior to the clearance of the check. I think this is misleading as I would have never withdrawn the money before the check cleared. As a result, I became the victim of a fraud and I 'm questioning the bank 's policies regarding clearing checks. I was told during numerous discussions with the Fraud department that the bank 's policy is to allow customers to use uncleared funds if their accounts are in good standing ; however, the policy appears to not be applied consistently as it was only applied once, for the fraudulent check I received. All checks I have deposited so far have taken more than XXXX days to clear. The policy was only applied to XXXX check which turned out to be fraudulent and the funds were deposited into another Bank of America account. The bank did not provide information regarding where the funds went or tried to do anything about it considering the money was deposited into another Bank of America account.  In conclusion, I believe that Bank of America 's policies and procedures have caused a loss for the amount of {$2600.00}. With my limited income and as a new immigrant, this is causing me and my family an unbearable financial burden and I 'm unable to pay my rent.  As I have exhausted all other options for resolution, I am writing to you and hoping you could help me understand why the bank 's policies are applied inconsistently. I do not blame the bank for the fraud, I blame the bank 's policies which when applied inconsistently may result in financial loss for the customers. I have also contacted the police which is investigating. ",liu1417@purdue.edu,0

8656,"ADDITIONAL INFORMATION RE : CFPB COMPLAINT # XXXX Dear Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, Yesterday, XXXX/XXXX/XXXX, I submitted a complaint regarding Union Bank. I wanted to add for your records that I have had XXXX major problems with this bank : 1 ) XXXX XXXX -- an unscrupulous debt collector, XXXX XXXX, an attorney in XXXX, XXXX, called me repeatedly at work over a very old credit card debt. In order to stop this harassment at my workplace, I very unwisely agreed to have $ XXXX/month payments taken out of my checking account. The original credit card debt was about {$500.00}.  Sure enough, XXXX office took withdrawals of {$500.00} here, {$300.00} there, another {$500.00} there, etc. My bank account, much to my dismay, was completely cleaned out by XX/XX/XXXX. At least XXXX or XXXX checks bounced. My brother-in-law and I then met with a Union Bank officer, XXXX XXXX, in the XXXX, XXXX office in XXXX XXXX. I filed a claim with the bank, and said I had only agreed to {$100.00} per month deductions to XXXX. The Risk Management/Loss Prevention department at Union Bank headquarters in XXXX, XXXX denied my claim, however, as they said I had an oral agreement with XXXX. I expressed much concern over all of the unsigned, electronic drafts that were made to XXXX, even though I had never approved of any of those amounts. My protests were to no avail. I should have hired an attorney at the time, but I could not afford one. It was an extremely painful lesson. I did file an online complaint with the Attorney General of the State of XXXX, but I never heard anything back.  2 ) XXXX XXXX - XXXX XXXX -- I received a new chip and pin debit card from Union Bank XX/XX/XXXX. The card did not work, however. My purchases were denied, and my automatic payments to XXXX XXXX on XX/XX/XXXX and XX/XX/XXXX were also denied, which caused my auto insurance to be canceled twice. ( I pay the insurance on my car, and also on my mom 's car. ) I was then sent a second chip and pin card ... that card did not work either. I actually went five weeks without any kind of a working bank debit card. Finally, the president of Union Bank, in the XXXX, XXXX office, helped me resolve the problem. He had heard about my continued bank card problems through the Union Bank customer service center and/or the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau ; the bank president then had a new chip and pin card sent to me via overnight mail in XXXX XXXX. I did appreciate his assistance, as well as the CFPB 's assistance, with the matter, and decided not to change banks.  XXXX ) XXXX XXXX -- I discovered that excessive checking account fees had been charged. I was never notified in advance of a {$30.00} per month bank charge for  having a low checking account balance.

Representative placed me on a brief hold and later stated that according to them, the terms and conditions on their end required me to purchase the product through the phone or through in-store channels and was not available through online purchase. In other words, their terms of purchase were completely different than what was displayed to me on my end. The representative stated further that he would escalate the dispute but expressed that my chances of a successful claim was slim.

I mentioned that my rent payment was dependent on this Social Security check, along with numerous electronic payments for various companies.

Well, my Social Security check was presented to Schwab and rejected the same day that I had called Schwab inquiring about when I would receive my new debt card and check blanks.

They were concerned that my account had experienced a large spike in activity. I was asked, then verified all charges as legitimate. The Chase rep stated that my account would be cleared by next business day. Still no access by next business day. When I followed up, the Chase rep then stated that they were investigating the source of the large wire transfer and I had to provide all of my invoices and tax returns to prove that I was a legitimate business. They did not provide this information willingly, though. Chase stated that under the Patriot Act, they do not have to explain themselves. However, I provided all requested documents. To date, I had been in business for over 2 years. Chase then stated I had to wait 10 business days for the investigation to clear. I did and the account was still frozen. After doing some searching regarding people who have experienced similar situations with Chase, I found that Chase had an Executive Customer Service office dedicated to solving out-of-ordinary issues. I called them. The rep was very apologetic and stated that my account would be accessible next business day. Next day, the account was still frozen. The rep who was originally assisting me was not there, and another representative stated that reactivating the account  takes time '' and that they  ca n't just press a button to make it happen. '' The next day with no access to my account, the original rep then admitted that someone had made an error and the investigation had started all over again. UNBELIEVABLE! I was asked to submit all my proof once again. So, today, I submitted all the SAME documents from the original request. I actually forwarded the same email I sent two weeks ago. Chase stated that they needed these documents again because they no longer had them in their possession. Where did my documents go? I had to submit my tax returns. Essentially, they have admitted misplacing documents with sensitive personal information. Everytime XXXX call, I am on the phone for at least 30-60 minutes. In the meantime, the money which would pay my salary, is being withheld, limiting resources that would support my family. I waited for the  investigation '' to run it 's course, was told that everything was cleared, and, then NOTHING HAPPENED. They provided no explanation of how this could come to pass. Now, they want to start the process over again. There is no transparency in the process. In addition to submitting this complaint, I have asked our Congressman 's office for help. If I do not get a resolution shortly, I will be forced to take legal action and post this rather embarrassing situation on social media. This, apparently, is the only way to get the attention of banks like Chase. ",afrances@purdue.edu,0

Upon following up again, they said I did not fulfill the agreement, and I was supposed to pay bills with their online bill payment system, not with the brand new gold debit card they gave me.  I have yet to find what they are basing this on, and I was clearly not aware of this, nor the branch where I opened it ever instructed me to do so.   Multiple disputes were denied, although, most reps I spoke with, said I deserved those points.  With every denial, I got a letter, saying if I want to reach out to them, I should call customer service, which is total useless, as they ca n't do anything. Sometimes they were rude, sometime nice, but always clueless, and powerless to do anything, resulting a loop, where I can never present my case.   Giving up on their  justice '', I closed the account, and now I am waiting to receive my check for the remaining balance. This check did not arrive yet, but I heard stories ( on their facebook page ) that those check are a hassle as well.   In my final attempt, I reached out to their social media team at XXXX, and there were very understanding, followed up in a professional manner, and tried their best to help me, along with open another dispute.  They identified with my situation, and were very understandable.  In our conversation a compromise was brought up, that I will pay two future months bill payment via the online service in order to complete the requirements ( as seen by the promotional team ).  Apparently, this was not possible as well, so I was left with no option but to close the account and reach out to Consumer Finance.

9032,"I have been banking with USBank for almost 20 years. I thought they were the BEST Bank. Then I noticed bank charges for things I opted OUT of, that USBank sent out.  When I asked why items were being paid when I had opted to NOT PAY IF the funds were NOT enough to do so. I never got a satisfying answer. Plus I was charged with OD Fees ; Multiple times.  Then we were victims of Fraudulent activity on both our Checking  Savings Accounts. USBank closed our Checking Account right away, but left our Savings Account open for 3 months longer. It was even getting Interest added to it. I had to call in  ask about what was happening with our Savings Account before they FINALLY closed it. In the meantime, both my husband  I were treated  talked DOWN to like we were beings of the lowest order.  Then AGAIN, just a couple of days ago, 3 items were paid even though I opted out.  I called Customer Service to found out WHY? I was told at the time it was presented the first time, WE HAD the funds available, BUT the Merchant did n't take the payment. They let the hold expire  NOW they were coming back to get the funds ; so my optingout in THIS case did n't apply so on top of the negative balance the 3 items caused, I was going to be charged 3 overdraft fees.  A week before the overdrafts happened, we ( my husband  I ) had decided to change banks. We got tired of the treatment you had gotten over the past few months. That 's the way they treat a customer who has been loyal off  on for almost 20 years? We 're DONE! We have paid out enough in fees. ",chen1331@purdue.edu,0

I have watched over the past 6 plus years as this account has continued to climb during the good markets times, yet continually declines in interest payments.

XXXX is for a {$400.00} ATM withdrawal and the other is for {$2200.00} in bogus charges ( such as XXXX {$970.00} and XXXX {$290.00} charge at XXXX ). Bank of America has handled my claims extremely poorly. They at first refunded me the money and later on with no contact whatsoever they took it all back ( not once warning me that this was possible ), leaving me with $ -XXXX in my account. I have since been charged over XXXX in fees because of this. Since then, I have been trying to prove that I in NO way authorized these charges and that my debit card and cell phone had been taken and used without my consent. They have been extremely unhelpful and I question their integrity. I have been at BOA since 2013 and have been pretty consistent with my banking and ( almost always ) on time with my payments. If you try to fully understand the details of the situation and what occurred, as well as what I was thinking, and the circumstances surrounding the situation ( the timeline ), the non- legitimacy of the charges become apparent. The fact that as of now, I have lost all of my savings and owe {$500.00} ( plus my BOA credit card bill ), while having to pay my {$1000.00} on my XXXX bill, is very unfair.
