1,"I 'm no longer an account holder of SunTrust. I used to be until I realized how unethical of a company that is. Let me explain to you why I believe this : For years, SunTrust advertised and promoted in big letters their XXXX XXXX debit card. With that card, an account holder could earn XXXX mile for every {$1.00} spent ( for debit and credit card transactions ). SunTrust even advertised that they would not put a cap on a cardholder 's ability to earn miles.   Over the past XXXX months, SunTrust must have reviewed their debit card portfolio and what they did as a result of their review is shocking : They closed all account holders who had earned above average number of miles regardless of the types of products they purchased, regardless of the length of their relationship with SunTrust, and regardless of the amount of money in their checking accounts. I know of at least XXXX cases where SunTrust contacted XXXX XXXX to have the miles in the cardholder 's account reversed!!!   SunTrust is clearly engaging in what is commonly referred to as  bait and switch '', a marketing strategy of getting customers to sign up for a product ( that, by the way, carries a yearly fee of {$75.00} ) and then, once a certain number of miles are earned, the account is closed. This is unacceptable and a regulatory violation.   If SunTrust does not immediately stop closing accounts and reversing miles already earned, I 'll notify a well-known XXXX XXXX lawfirm to pursue a class action lawsuit against SunTrust and its XXXX and XXXX individually.

6,"There are two components to the bank fraud that I discovered this morning.  1 ) Wells Fargo changed my corporate bank account number without advising me.  2 ) A customer attempted to send me an electronic payment last Friday via ACH. I never received the payment. After contacting Wells Fargo, they explained that my bank account changed. I then attempted to determine when this changed by looking at the previous bank statements. When I pulled my XXXX XX/XX/2015 bank statement from their online banking system the statement reflected the NEW account number. I then pulled a copy of my XXXX XX/XX/2015 statement from my local drive which I had downloaded back in XXXX. The XXXX statements ARE DIFFERENT. Meaning, that the Wells Fargo Online Banking system is displaying incorrect banking information to their consumers ( i.e. fraud ). It is not clear because no one has investigated this whether this is the result of fraud, weak internal controls in their IT process or some other reason. No consumer should assume that the information they are receiving from Wells Fargo is credible or accurate.   ",dai77@purdue.edu,1

Financially things are not good for me ; I just received a Chapter XXXX Discharge of debt and I live check to check.  Every now and then I get hit with an overdraft because certain transactions charged to my account as charge not a debit are deducted from my account and then a few days later the charge completely disappears from online statement and is credited to my account as usable funds and then pops up in the ledger again for the final charge against my account.  My branch tells me the problem is created on the merchant 's side The most recent occurrence I even called the bank to inquire if I had any outstanding charges against my account that were not itemized and any amounts that were not included in my balance.  I was told by customer service that according to their ledger I had enough money in my account to cash the check to transfer my money to another account for my mortgage payment.  Chase has always been good to me and reimburses the OD FEES, but they limit their customers to XXXX in a one year period, My complaint is not against the bank nor the merchant, it is the procedure that I feel needs a look at.  My other bank, a credit union, does not alter the usable number, all transactions are withheld from my account and the ledger shows a greater total but a lesser usable amount especially if the merchant enters the transaction as charge and not a debit ; my total amount and usable amount even up when all transactions have actually been paid ; this is the fair/upfront way of managing the accounts of the customers.

When they clear, even if cleared the same day or the deposit clears prior to the expense, an overdraft fee is assessed.   Additionally, it becomes difficult to track because of the disjointed design of the banking statements and online account view.   The statement separates deposits, expenses and daily balances.

XXXX of the credit reports deleted it after I disputed it ; the other one would not delete it.   When I tried to resolve this issue with the bank, I was shocked they told me yes, I am in their computer as I have had a credit card with them for three months. I asked them :  Do you issue credit cards from your bank to unemployed people? Because I was unemployed on such dates so how would I get a credit card from your bank? '' They said no, they do n't issue credit cards to unemployed people, so they will investigate. Then they sent me a letter and a package full of fraud.   The letter attached dated XXXX XXXX, XXXX falsely claims I had : a ) a credit card from XXXX XXXX to XXXX XXXX, and b ) a savings account those same dates ; and c ) falsely claims a checking account from XXXX XXXX to XXXX XXXX, originally opened at  XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX '' later acquired by Fifth Third.   I have never even heard of that bank, and I do not keep my money in banks, but in credit unions. So all this information in their letter to me is false.

More importantly, since it was not authorized by me, if the transaction would continue as indicated, I was assured that the money would promptly be returned to me. I asked them to appropriately note my file and send me written confirmation to that effect.

Told that I 'd be contacted soon and have the money returned in 48 hours, no action was taken and no call received by the bank in 36 hours so I contacted the bank again.

After XXXX or XXXX heated conversations with the branch bank manager she took {$15.00} off for extended od fee reversal and {$19.00} off for extended overdraft on XX/XX/XXXX.

The tellers at the bank have told me that if an account is in overdraft during the week, the customer is giving until Friday of that week to correct the credit. But if not taken care of before Friday, a {$15.00} charge is attached. If not taken care of by the Monday of the following week a {$34.00} charge is attached. XXXX more {$34.00} is allowed and that is all. This was my understanding of the overdraft circumstances with Chase but it has not be the case with this situation or in other situations with Chase.

XXXX of the debts included in the bankruptcy was my USAA credit card with a remaining balance that was under {$3000.00}. Intent on trying to turn things around, I signed up to monitor my credit through USAA 's partnership with XXXX. However, soon thereafter I tried to log onto my USAA account and I received the following message :  According to our records you filed bankruptcy and we can not collect certain debts. To obtain access to your existing accounts you may log on by clicking proceed below. ( XXXX ) '' The link took me to a limited and cumbersome USAA Web site and I was no longer able to access my XXXX credit monitoring account. The Web site also gave me limited access to my USAA Automobile Insurance policy and my USAA Auto loans ( which I continued to pay and reaffirmed in the bankruptcy - so USAA did not lose anything on those XXXX loans ).  I wrote a letter to USAA ( attached ) stating that it seems the only purpose of displaying this message in bold red and redirecting members to a limited and cumbersome Web site is purely punitive and to humiliate its members further. There is no benefit to USAA. It is only a punishment and a humiliation for someone like me who had no other option following a divorce and failed business venture. So every time I log on to make my car payments or to pay my insurance bill or to access some other service at USAA, I am further humiliated. If this is USAA 's purpose and goal, then it has succeeded - I am further humiliated and reminded of my failure a few times each month.  I received a call responding to my letter - no one wrote back. I was told that the reason for the limited Web site was so that USAA would not inadvertently extend any further credit to me following my bankruptcy. This makes no sense. They could refuse to extend additional credit to me without redirecting me to a cumbersome Web site and displaying the humiliating message. I am also a member of XXXX XXXX, and had to include a debt from their company, but they do n't display humiliating messages or redirect me to some cumbersome Web site. It seems the only reason for USAA to have this policy is punitive.   ",cthieme@purdue.edu,1

317,"Capital One has violated these laws, as explained below : Consumer Financial Protection Act, FTC Section 5, Truth in Savings Act, Electronic Funds Transfer Act, Maryland Consumer Fraud Protection Act.   Capital One forced open our safe deposit box and liquidated its contents without notice to us. Through mishandling, they lost the contents. They insisted that they forced the box open because we did not pay the rental fees. In fact, our checking account was set up such that the rental fees were automatically debited from the account each year. At some point, due to a security concern, we changed our checking account number. Capital One failed to link the new account number to the safe deposit box, which is what led to the perceived nonpayment. At no time did Capital One give us notice that there was an issue with the fees, nor did they give us notice when they forced the box open and liquidated the contents.  Our box contained irreplaceable jewelry that my parents purchased for us as wedding gifts from XXXX. As is common in XXXX families, these pieces of jewelry have incredible tangible, not to mention, sentimental value. The box also contained some legal documents concerning my uncle 's estate, which are irreplaceable and difficult to re-execute, considering he lives in another country.   Capital One claims to have sent the property to the Maryland Division of Unclaimed Property, despite that documentation the bank itself provided to me showed that nothing but  miscellaneous documents '' were sent, despite also giving us an inventory showing that the box contained several pieces of jewelry. The Division has conducted exhaustive searches and has confirmed that it never received, nor does it have, any of our property from Capital One.

We have impressed upon them that the injury was inflicted when they failed to link the new account number to the box and failed to give us notice, but they continue to attempt to shift the blame to the XXXX.   Capital One has further indicated that they do not believe we ever signed up for automatic debit form our account to pay the box rental fees. However, they in fact debited our account for the fees for approximately XXXX years. If they do not believe we had signed up for automatic debit, then debiting our account without our consent constitutes a violation of the Electronic Funds Transfer Act, 15 U.S.C. 1693a et seq., as well as the NACHA rules.   We sued Capital One in federal court on an individual basis. Again, rather than address the merits, they chose to fight us on jurisdictional grounds. This is what prompted us to file a class action in Maryland, to fight for our rights and those of others similarly situated. Ultimately, the bank will have to address the merits of our claims and those of others.

I was told that there would be no issue as long as the check was taken inside a branch and the deposit was made with a teller.

I had to close all of my accounts transfer money, deactivate cards, the whole XXXX yards. My main financial institution is Union Bank of CA, I have been banking with them since XX/XX/XXXX. I can honestly say in addition to my purse getting stolen Union Bank added to my stress with their lack of customer service and concern for me as a customer, and not to mention me still not getting the money that was stolen from my account. I went into the bank sunday afternoon on XXXX XXXX XXXX located in XXXX, CA to open a new account. Prior to my funds being stolen I had XXXX in my checking account and XXXX in my savings. I had XXXX fraudulent charges totaling XXXX which left my checking account at a balance on XXXX and my savings at a balance of XXXX. Because of the fraud I transferred the XXXX to my savings leaving me with a balance of XXXX ( checking and savings total ) and some change. I opened my new checking account on Sunday the XXXX, me and the teller XXXX transferred the XXXX ( available checking ) to my new checking and took out XXXX cash which left me with XXXX ( new checking account ) and still kept the balance on XXXX in my savings. Mind you the XXXX was already stolen so all of this money still is n't accounted for and I 'm still short {$100.00} from bills. After I left the teller I look at my bank account XX/XX/XXXX and see a balance of XXXX in my checking including a credit from XXXX and a deduction from XXXX XXXX and an overdraft of XXXX in my savings and XXXX in my new checking account. So the next step I took was going back up to the bank, I talked with the manager XXXX and he himself was also confused because of what transpired on my account. XXXX proceeded to make sense of my account and turned my savings from a negative to a positive, with the XXXX balance that was available to me at the time. From him doing this that left me with XXXX ( savings ) and XXXX in my checking account because a check was deducted for XXXX. After doing all of this it left my fraud checking account at a XXXX balance because the payments that were pending from fraud had n't posted to my account yet. Fast forward to Thursday I submitted all proper paper work to Union Bank because my claim was over XXXX and XXXX advised me that I would be in contact with the Claims dept. I called and talked with the Claims department and they advised me that I would receive a provisional credit to cover the amount that was overdraft from the fraud charges. Mind you I as a customer am also still at a loss of the XXXX myself, I still have yet to touch the money and no balances have yet credited my new account in the money that was lost to me as a customer. All the claims department did was give union bank money back to their own account to wash out my fraud checking and leave it at a XXXX balance!

Bank of America debit cards are used by California 's XXXX Department in place of XXXX checks : the state sends pre-loaded debit cards to workers out on XXXX leave. I was one of those workers receiving a XXXX benefit after XXXX last year. After my leave was finished and I returned to full-time employment, I was unhappy to learn that my card number had been used by someone other than me and that my card had a zero balance. The number had been used on several occasions, some of which occurred when I was at my office, and there were charges of close to {$500.00} at several XXXX locations within the space of XXXX hours on opposite ends of XXXX XXXX County. These took place on a Sunday when I was at home.   As the card had never been out of my possession, it was obvious this was a case of fraud. But proving that to B of A has been impossible. I immediately contacted California XXXX, I filed a report with B of A 's Fraud Department, as well as one with the XXXX XXXX County sheriff 's department, and I also contacted each store 's security team. The security staff at one XXXX location, where many of the purchases were made, let me know that they reviewed the recorded footage where the transactions were supposed to have occurred. The register was n't in use at that time. Quite literally, no one was there. While the staff was baffled and concerned, there was nothing they could do.

In no way does this practice help the people who are supposed to be getting benefits. And shame on B of A for refusing to help a consumer who has gone out of her way over the course of several weeks to gather evidence, file reports and do all the legwork.

Now if you were closing the account why in the great love of XXXX continue to debit another account for the opening deposit. Way after they the fact that you stated that you were going to close the account. Each time that they did n't receive the money they charge me an overdraft fee and and NSF fees which overdrew the account. So they reported me to both XXXX and XXXX with these Contribution Reasons : An account closed and charged off by the contributor, in whole or in part via an automated process, where the contributor has recorded a loss and where the Contributor does not, or is not able to identify the closing of the accounts as due to fraud.

636,"Yesterday I received an email notification that my Wells Fargo account had been overdrawn and I had used my overdraft protection. I was surprised by this email as this account is only used to pay my student loans and I know exactly what goes into it and what comes out of it. I got online to check my account and found almost {$50.00} in fees in the last 3 months and a XXXX balance in my checking account. What surprised me the most was a $ 8 monthly service fee for each month in XXXX, XXXX and XXXX. I have had this account for 8 years ( since 2007 ) and have never paid a monthly service fee because I set up an automatic transfer of {$35.00} between my checking and savings account to waive the {$6.00} normal monthly fee of this type of account. As I checked back through my online statements I found the change happened around XXXX this year where my account must have been automatically  updated '' without my consent or knowledge to an account that now charges {$10.00} a month and the options to waive the fee have changed and my option to transfer to my savings account has been removed. The only options left to waive my monthly fee consisted of having a minimum {$1500.00} balance, having a direct deposit of at least $ XXXX, or having an automatic payment be taken for a Wells Fargo home loan or personal loan. None of these options are usable for me as this account is only used to pay my student loans. I currently live in XXXX and I do n't have the option to go into a branch near me to sort things out so I called the XXXX number and talked to XXXX separate people that both basically said they could not help me at all. The only suggestion they had was to call the branch I opened it at. This morning I called the branch and talked to a banker named XXXX. He was more helpful but overall said that since I live in XXXX and can not physically be there, he could not do anything to my accounts to help me. He confided that I was not the first to call and complain about this change that happened and that apparently this change happened to about XXXX types of older accounts that had been  grandfathered. '' He said they would have sent out a letter at the beginning of the year informing me of the changes. When I stated I did not receive any such letter he suggested it might have gotten lost in the mail or something as it would have been going overseas. I have since checked my letters from Wells Fargo in my filing cabinet and have not found any such letter, though I did find my most recent debit card which would have arrived around that time to my XXXX address, indicating the overseas mailing address is indeed correct. In XXXX we never have problems receiving mail and have a very reliable mail system. XXXX directed me back towards the phone call center which I had previously called, sending me in circles.

Before I closed the account, I checked the account information in online banking and saw that the last pending item, ( which was an online bill payment to XXXX XXXX in the amount of {$1500.00} XXXX had cleared my account and no longer showed as  pending ''. When I was at the branch closing the account, I specifically asked the teller if she was showing anything in the account in a  pending '' status, and she indicated that she did not. In addition, my XXXX XXXX account showed a credit posted to the account on XXXX XXXX, 2015 in the amount of {$1500.00}, which was the online bill pay transaction. On XXXX XXXX, 2015, I received an email and a phone call from XXXX XXXX indicating that the {$1500.00} payment from TD Bank had been returned. I immediately called TD Bank 's customer service number to find out what happened. The customer service representative initially told me that she had no idea what I was talking about and that she reviewed my account and did n't see any record of a payment to XXXX XXXX and did n't show me having a balance of {$1500.00}. It took roughly a half hour and lots of time spent on hold while she looked into it further and concluded that TD Bank did not process the payment because I closed my account. She said that she did not know where the {$1500.00} was and that I needed to go in to my local branch to get the issue resolved because my account was showing a {$0.00} balance. A little while later that day I went to the XXXX branch and spoke with XXXX XXXX. She looked at my account and similarly could n't figure out what had happened and did not know how to go about getting my {$1500.00} back. She made a call to another office, and apparently they told her that she needed to send an email to central processing to request that they send me a check. XXXX indicated that she would follow up with me by the next day to let me know the status of my reimbursement for the {$1500.00}. I never heard anything back from XXXX. I still have not received the {$1500.00}. I have not been contacted by TD Bank at all over the course of this issue. Additionally, because of the returned payment, XXXX XXXX charged me a returned payment fee of {$27.00}, and I incurred interest charges in the amount of {$57.00} because the returned payment resulted in my account carrying a past due balance.

I went to a Citibank Atm and deposited {$20.00} which is still in the account at the time this complaint is being filed. I tried to use my bank card and it was declined twice. Once I got home I called customer service who told me there was a restriction on the account and I needed to call new account services. I was also informed that I had XXXX accounts. I told them I only wanted XXXX and gave them the account number of the one in which to keep, the one with the {$20.00}. So just to be exact I am writing this complaint pertaining to the account ending in XXXX. On Monday, XXXX XXXX 2015, I called new account services where I was informed that I needed to send in proof of address.

I called the next day which was XXXX XXXX 2015 to verify that new account services received my fax, they did. Later that day I received a call from a number I did not recognize, XXXX. The gentleman on the line explained that he was calling on behalf of Citibank and he was the XXXX reviewing my proof of address I sent in and he thought to check with me because my XXXX bill had an apartment number and I did not put one on my bank application. I explained to him that it did not matter because I stayed in a hotel and all mail came through the front desk, so I would get it as long as it came to this address, the same one that I gave them on my XXXX bill as my proof of address. He asked if this address is permanent, I assured him it was. He then explained to me that he would have to talk to his supervisor as they usually do n't give accounts to people in hotels. He said he would call me back after he spoke with his supervisor, either later that day or the next. The next day I waited, I did not receive a call so I called new account services. They explained to me that the account was denied by XXXX and I will be receiving a letter soon. I feel as though I have been a victim of discrimination again. Where I live should not play a part in whether I get an account. I gave all my documents as asked of me. I already had the account, they sent me a card, so the only reason for them declining or closing my newly opened account has to do with the address where I live. I am not sure of the reason they put in the letter or the reason they will give your organization but I feel that it should be known that I have the card and even placed money in the account. The reason for them closing the account has to do with the fact that my address where I am a permanent resident is a hotel. I do n't think that people who live in hotels, or shelters, or any residence that Citibank does not agree with should be a reason that a person is denied an account.   ",dai77@purdue.edu,0

In XXXX, the branch manager informed us that the bank had misplaced our signature cards and they required a new one in order to keep our account in good standing. In reviewing our account, it came to the attention of the bank that we had an ATM on site. US Bank had inquired about ATM activity and asked that we make withdrawals daily when for the last 30+ years we 've been making deposits and withdrawals weekly. It is worth pointing out that our ATM does n't allow deposits. US Bank 's XXXX staff asked us to make cash withdrawals daily instead of weekly. We argued that daily withdrawals do n't fit into our workflow and that we are a low money laundering risk. Upon request, we provided a list of vendors along with a .pdf of our reconciliation paperwork on XXXX XXXX, 2015. In mid XXXX we resubmitted the signature card to the branch, at which time the branch manager informed us that a letter may be sent informing us of our account closure, but to disregard it now that we had everything submitted. The branch manager thought the documentation provided was very clear and precisely what the bank required. On XXXX XXXX, we went and did our deposit and our online bill pay, like normal. On XXXX XXXX, when going in for a change order, we discovered that our payroll account had already been closed and that our other XXXX account were in the process of being closed.

Each call the representative would make an incorrect statement, and I would get a different person each time. I have never received a point of contact. The incorrect statements of USAA FSB policies, and my situation could be due to calls being answered by subcontractors lacking adequate knowledge and training. I was told that would prevent further withdrawals. When I asked about the investigation into how another FSB member could withdraw funds from my saving account, I was told there was no investigation. When banks receives a complaint of fraud or theft, they are obligated to investigate the complaint and respond with a report within XXXX working days. I asked if I could be transferred to the fraud department. The Fraud Department stated their was no investigation because the Written Statement of Unauthorized Debit form ( WSUD ) I submitted on XXXX XXXX 2015, was canceled by the FSB. The day I completed the XXXX, I uploaded it to my XXXX, it was returned back to me the same evening, and the decision was made not to investigate the theft from my savings account. On XXXX XXXX, 2015 at XXXX., I spoke with XXXX XXXX who stated the mistake is the FSB and offered to return all three withdrawals taken by XXXX XXXX. He stated that the error was on USAA FSB. In speaking with XXXX XXXX XXXX, I found out that the individual, XXXX XXXX XXXX, is a USAA FSB consume, and that my account numbers are similar. I told XXXX XXXX that each call I have made to the FSB, I have been told I can not receive my money that was taken with my approval beyond 60 days. The funds taken with the FSB approval was my Social Security XXXX Insurance back pay, and transferred into another FSB member 's outside investment account with XXXX XXXX. The Social Security I receive is affected by my limited income and unemployability. Anyone with income or resources above the SSI income and resource limits are not eligible for the need-based XXXX program, like the one I receive. Should the Social Security Administration take note that my benefits provided for my XXXX, is being transferred to an investment account, I could lose my benefits. The next day, I received a call from XXXX XXXX at approximat4elyXXXX. XXXX XXXX spoke about the XXXX agreement however, XXXX XXXX went into details about how long she been in the banking business and this situation occurs frequently. She remarked that obviously XXXX XXXX was not monitoring his account like me. I quickly told XXXX XXXX that I was the victim, not XXXX XXXX, who has been taking our funds.

848,"Hi, I have a circle checking account ( # XXXX XXXX XXXX ) with Citizens bank.  I recently visited a branch XX/XX/XXXX to deposit a check and during that visit was told that my account is dormant. Apparently since XX/XX/XXXX up to this point, due to my account being inactive, I have been charged monthly fee of {$5.00}.  Since XX/XX/XXXX was Saturday, the manager at that branch was not able to answer questions on when did my account started being dormant, why there has been no communication from bank about it, I went to my regular branch ( XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX ) to inquire about my account. I wanted to check why bank have NOT notify me in anyway about changes to my account status from active to dormant. I also did not receive any notification that I will be charged fees for keeping this account. The bank representative told me that I have eStatements, and if I have logged in and checked my balance, I would notice that I am being charged fees.  I may have logged in to the account, but I believe bank eStatement are different that receiving notification from bank about account change. In my opinion, I should have received letter sent to my home address notifying me about charges that I will be occurring for keeping this account. I logged in today and tried to see if bank send me any notification via their system, but since they started charging me XX/XX/XXXX, I am not able to review any information ( see attached for showing no eNotices on my account ). The representative in the bank said that they can not see any communication on my account, but eStatements.  Attached is my XX/XX/XXXX eStatement. I do not see any explanation of those dormant charges ... there is a note saying that I can waive a {$15.00} maintenance fee if I keep certain balance on the account ( see attached ), however I do not think this applicable to my account.  However, there is no information what the dormant account means, when it started and what I have to do as customer to avoid this fee. I think this falls into UDaP ( unfair and Deceptive practice ), since bank did not notify customer of charges to the account. Yes, I could have logged in to the account to check my statement but I think with such substantial change of the account terms, there should have been a courtesy letter sent to my home address to notify me. There also should have been better explanation of the charge ( why am I being charged this and what I can do to stop being charged this fee ). I am very disappointed that bank would take {$95.00} dollars from my account. I can not believe that bank would charge me for 19 months a set fee and would not notify me. I know that they have correct correspondence address on the account, since they sent me a new ATM card. If I would have not go to the bank to deposit a check, I would continue to be unaware of diminishing account founds. At what point would bank notify me about the charges, when I would run out of money?  Please advise of best way to receive refund of those charges. In my belief my account should have {$550.00} not {$450.00}. How do I go about receiving {$95.00} back into my account? I appreciate you looking into my case.  When I visited the XXXX XXXX XXXX branch ( XX/XX/XXXX ), I was informed that I should have received a letter from the bank notifying me about upcoming charges and that I should have signed it and return it to the bank.

945,"Around XX/XX/XXXX or XX/XX/XXXX, I banked with Wells Fargo in XXXX, Az. I had checking, savings, and credit card accounts. I was a college student and my tuition status changed from out-of-state to in-state and so the amount of my financial aid checks significantly increased. At this time, I thought it would be a good idea to try to build credit history by putting a number of charges on my credit card and then paying it down when I received my next financial aid check.  However, XXXX semester, after I had made a large payment from my checking or savings account to my credit card account, I noticed there was still a lot of money in my checking or savings account. I went to the Wells Fargo at XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX, AZ XXXX and asked a bank representative where this money came from. I was told that since I had made a credit card payment that far exceeded the minimum payment, some of my payment was put back into my checking or savings account. I did not complain or ask that it be reapplied to my credit card account.  At the time, I was not aware that cash advances carried a larger APR than purchases. It was some time afterwards that I realized this and recalled this incident. In XX/XX/XXXX or XX/XX/XXXX, I began requesting from Wells Fargo credit card and bank statements from that time period around XX/XX/XXXX to XX/XX/XXXX.

At this point, I had been paying interest on hundreds of dollars of cash advances.  It was around this time that I noticed that my credit card statement no longer showed a balance for cash advances. To this day, I have a XXXX balance for cash advances.  I have been hesitant to bring up the whole issue with Wells Fargo for fear that the cash advance balance will return to my credit card. I do not know how much interest I paid over the years for the cash advance balance so I do not have a dollar amount that I am looking for in compensation.  Also, Wells Fargo has asked a number of times if I would like to close the credit card account and open up a line of credit at a lower APR. I have been hesitant to do this as well, as I am unsure if that will erase any records of all this.  Like I stated above, there is not a dollar amount that I am looking to be compensated.

1026,"My wife and I have been having an issue with PNC. We changed my individual account into a joint account around the end of XXXX. On XXXX XXXX they pulled money from the account for XXXX as well as a child support payment that was going to her that was around {$85.00} for a total of {$180.00}. We were giving not notification and when it initially showed as pending we thought it was some kind of fraud. When we called PNC they said they could n't see the transaction until it posted. We asked at that point well if the account has been compromised what can we do they said we would have to wait until transaction posted to see for sure. In other words if account is compromised they ca n't do anything until transactions start to post which sounds preposterous to begin with.  After the transaction posted we called back in and they advised that it was due to charges to her old closed account. They could n't give us any details and even gave conflicting information, we were told it was all from XXXX old account and another time it was from XXXX old accounts, XXXX closed in XX/XX/XXXX and XXXX in XX/XX/XXXX. They would not provide us further information so not only are they charging us money but they can not even show us what it is for.  We went to the branch where we changed it over to a joint account and the apologized for the issue, that they have no way of seeing that when they change over the account, and that they would open up a complaint case for us. A complaint case was opened, XXXX, that was assigned to XXXX XXXX at XXXX, extension XXXX. It took a couple weeks to reach her but once we did she advised it was due to right to offset and there was nothing they could do since it is in the disclosure statement. I brought up the issue that they did not even advise us the money would be taken out and it was n't done right away and she said they would work to make process better but there was nothing they could do to refund the money. I also brought up the child support issue and they advised there is nothing preventing them from pulling from that either, that only social security and XXXX are protected. At best this is unethical but I do not believe the right to offset includes automatically taking child support so it borders on being illegal. The account that we have is based in Maryland which usually has much better consumer protection laws than surrounding states so I believed that they need to also provide notification before taking any money from account, not that they did n't have right to non-child support money but have to at least provide notification prior to taking it.  There have been additional issues in the past. XXXX in particular I have a large issue with is I wrote a check on the XXXX of a month. I did not see it post or even show pending until the XXXX. When it posted on the XXXX it actually posted on the XXXX. I had paid some bills early on the XXXX since I got paid and check did n't even show up against account yet. Luckily I had enough money in the account to cover anything but them posting an item that does n't show up on account at all until the XXXX for a back date seems highly questionable to me. PNC advised this was a standard practice and that you just have to account for check once it 's been written. I understand what they are saying but at same time if I see that something is n't even pending on account I should be able to use that money without fear of something being back dated on account.

I deposited the check in my account but something seemed strange as he kept messaging me to wire money to the address he provided. I immediately contacted Chase Bank 's fraud department on XXXX XXXX and told them of my concern regarding the check and the way the buyer was acting. The person at the fraud department told me I was the second person this week who was scammed by XXXX and they put a hold on the check I received a letter in the mail verifying this the phone call was also recorded and I also sent an email to XXXXXXXXXXXX as instructed by the Chase rep in the fraud department. On XXXX XXXX Chase released the funds into my account even though I warned them of the potentially fraud that this check posed. I then went to use my card on XXXX XXXX my card was declined I called Chase to ask what the issue was they told me my account was scheduled for closure but would n't tell me why. I then went into Chase to talk to a account specialist she proceeded to call Chase and they told her my account was restricted and under investigation for fraud as a result of the check that Chase put through that I told them I felt was fraudulent. My account was then scheduled for closure all my checks written ahead of that time were returned and debits as well causing me to incur fees with those parties as well as damage my reputation further, my scheduled deposits were frozen as well causing me to miss my mortgage payment as well. Chase then sent me a letter regarding the account closure and also threatened that they would report this have it put on my credit report and inform other banks so I ca n't open an account anywhere. I was a victim of fraud and alerted Chase to this they took it upon themselves to process this check into my account even after the fact how am I liable? Besides the threating letter the lack of communication at Chase bank is appalling, as there customer service and fraud department gave me a different excuse every time. I understand that the bank reserves the right as to how to handle accounts my only issue is that I do n't want this to affect my credit, reputation, or ability to open a bank account as I exercised integrity and was forthright in this whole process.

1177,"To Whom It May Concern : Please be advised that the filing of this complaint with the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (  CFPB '' ) follows a summary complaint filed with the Office of the Comptroller of the Currencies (  O.C.C.  ), without supporting documents, and is intended to notify Bank of America (  BofA '' ) of my intentions to pursue litigation for unfair and deceptive banking practices as it relates to recording bank transactions ( i.e. backdating banking activity ) in an effort to charge additional overdraft bank fees. I 've incurred these overdraft charges as a result of either a broad and systemic bank issue or the bank has intentionally levied fees against me in the wake of a successful consumer lawsuit against the bank. The lawsuit involved a consumer credit reporting dispute against Bank of America involving the Fair Credit Reporting Act (  FCRA '' ) to which the bank was found negligent back in XXXX XXXX in the XXXX District Court of Massachusetts.  The following provides a summary explanation of banking activity involving a primary checking account and XXXX bill payments processed through the primary checking account that evidently occurred between XXXX XXXX and XXXX XXXX of XXXX. Bank notifications supplied by Bank of America call into question the sequence of the XXXX bill payments as well as the accuracy of the primary checking account 's balance on XXXX XXXX, XXXX which the bank controlled and therefore relied upon to charge the overdraft fees. The sequence of these XXXX bill payments and the resulting overdraft fees is neither consistent nor supported by customer notifications initiated by the bank to indicate recent bank activity and the primary checking account 's balance ( s ).  The primary checking account that my wife and I hold with Bank of America had a beginning balance of {$41.00} prior to XXXX bill payment transactions that Bank of America has reported as occurring on XXXX XXXX, XXXX. [ See Exhibit XXXX ] A payment to my wife 's XXXX XXXX account was scheduled to transact on XXXX XXXX, XXXX for {$30.00} through the bank 's online payment web portal. On XXXX XXXX, XXXX, I received an email notification from Bank of America indicating that our primary checking account balance fell below the {$25.00} pre-determined amount that was set by the customer to notify of low balances. [ See Exhibit XXXX XXXX The email notification indicates that the primary checking account balance of {$41.00} had decreased to {$11.00} as expected following the {$30.00} XXXX XXXX payment.  On the following day XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX XXXX, I received another email notification the primary checking account had become overdrawn. As the bank explains, the overdrawn balance was the result the {$30.00} XXXX XXXX bill payment as well as a bill payment for {$180.00} to XXXX. [ See Exhibit XXXX ] Based on the documentation and statements provided by Bank of America, I contacted their customer support center on the evening of XXXX XXXX, XXXX to dispute the overdraft charge on the XXXX XXXX payment and to request a refund of that overdraft fee. [ See Exhibit XXXX ] The explanation by the bank representative as well as the notifications and statements do not support the processing of the {$180.00} XXXX payment first. First, Exhibit XXXX clearly indicates that a {$30.00} transaction occurred to change the primary checking account balance from a beginning balance of {$41.00}, to {$11.00}. [ See Exhibit XXXX ] Secondly Exhibit XXXX clearly indicates the {$30.00} XXXX XXXX payment first in sequence as evidenced by the transaction number ( s ) indicated in the bank 's document. Finally, Exhibit XXXX shows the same sequencing of payments with the {$30.00} XXXX XXXX payment first in order.

I actually think its embarrassing, and upsetting you have to call your bank for this, and when you do they do n't do anything for you, but if you owed them money you ca n't let them wait or make your own judgement on the matter. They sent me latters in the mail saying the transactions were just, and the atm film too. How does that even make sense? They are not just, because I reported them to the bank as fraud. It 's only like {$1000.00} not a {&gt;= $1,000,000}, and that money was for my everyday survival. It 's sad to see a bank like this not help its customers the way they should, and I think these banks get away with anything they want too and that 's not fair to us the people that keep these banks running with our money.

1215,"this occurred about four years ago. my father was staying at the XXXX on XXXX in XXXX california. i had made one payment for him with my debit card and at the time i did so i had noticed that they were entering my credit card into a windows computer, not just sliding it in a regular credit card machine, so i was concerned that they were recording the card information. i made it clear that this was a one time charge and that they did not have my permission so make further charges to the card and i asked them to not record the card number. they agreed and assurred me that they would not make future charges to my card. several weeks later i noticed that they had charged around {$380.00} to my account without asking my permission and without even informing me ahead of time that they were doing it. i was very angry because there wasnt even enough money in my account to cover that charge, and in putting that unauthorized charge through, wells fargo had also caused a number of legitimate checks to bounce ( i believe they were XXXX checks written to book sales i frequented so it was very embarrassing ). i was very angry, i basically considered this identity theft and called wells fargo and they had me file some sort of internal appeal, which they found in their own favor without explanation and then refused to talk to me further. i think that they did this because this charge was put through by a XXXX employee who had basically done an identity theft crime and they didnt want it to be recognized as such. this was very unfair to me, how can you hold me responsible for what goes on in my bankaccount if any hotel employee who writes down my debit card number is allowed to charge things to my account without my permission? how can i possibly responsibly manage my own banking if someone is allowed to take money out of the account without my permission and without warning, and even if there isnt enough money to cover the charge? its ridiculous. in addtion wells fargo charged me {$200.00} worth of bounced check fees that they would not otherwise have gotten if they hadnt put this unauthorized charge through.  wells fargo closed my accounts and put my name in the XXXX database, which prevents me from ever doing XXXX in america again. i went to several other banks and i was indeed blackballed from any sort of XXXX in america.  a year or so later my father died and i tried to get a bank account again. i talked to XXXX XXXX in the XXXX wells fargo office and he called wells fargo corporate offices and they told him they would give me an account if i just gave them {$380.00}. my brother gave wells fargo {$380.00} and wells fargo went through the motions of pretending to open up an account for me, filling out paperwork and assigning an account number to me. in the following week though, the account never opened up. i went back to the wells fargo office and they told me they were not really going to open an account for me, that they had just said that so i would give them {$380.00}.

I was very angry at this deception and demanded the {$380.00} back. they refused to give me my money back. wells fargo is truly sleazy bank by the way dont mail anything to the address i give below i dont live there anymore, thanks to wells fargo i went from making {$80000.00} a year to being homeless. its ridiculous how there is no regulation at all of crooked banks like wells fargo   ",krohn@purdue.edu,1

1217,"This may also be a credit card complaint. I was issued a credit card over two years ago from a Wells Fargo branch that I did not authorize in any way. The teller asked me if I wanted overdraft protection on my account since my husband had it. I said sure and went along with my banking that day. When I received a card in the mail asking for activation I immediately contacted the branch and made a complaint. Action was taken with the employee and I never authorized my card. In XXXX 2015 my husband was reviewing our accounts and found that we had a late payment for about {$500.00}. This was stressing because we are very much on top of our accounts and have over XXXX credit scores that are very important to us and our business. We went into the same bank branch to determine what happened and it turned out that we overdrafted money one day when we made a withdrawal just before we deposited more money. This kicked in the overdraft credit card that I never authorized or even knew we had. We immediately took care of our charges, and asked the bank to remove the financing charges and any impact this would have to our credit. They removed the financing charges and we wanted to close the card, but they said it would impact my credit score. This seemed really unfair because I never approved this card, found out two years later it existed, and now ca n't close it without a negative impact on my credit. We had multiple conversations with the branch manager and it was moved up to the highest level of Wells Fargo, or at least that is what we were told, when they denied us the opportunity to close the card without a negative impact on my credit. I am reporting this in full as a complaint on the issuance of the card and the bank handling correcting a mistake.

1446,"A bank ( BoA ) incorrectly listed me as having late fees on their credit card which appeared on my credit report while applying for a loan. I had pulled my credit report prior to applying for the loan and it was not on the report, it was applied sometime within 30 days of applying for the loan. I 've never had a BoA credit card so I knew it was not mine. I attempted to dispute directly with BoA but they were difficult to deal with.

BoA confirmed the error and stated they would notify the XXXX reporting firms. Within 60 days I received a letter stating BoA considered the issue 'closed '. I am dubious and frankly concerned. My loan was questioned due to the incorrect reporting on behalf of BoA ; BoA offered little to no assistance in correcting the error ; and I can not obtain my 'free ' credit reports to measure whether the 'error ' was in fact removed as I had pulled my reports earlier this year. So how does one verify for free that errors were removed? It would seem that if a letter is received from a bank/firm allegedly stating the  issue is closed '' then a consumer should be allowed to obtain free verification of their credit report at the cost of the bank/firm that made the error.  Why are banks/firms allowed to report 'errors ' yet there is minimal responsibility on the banks/firms to correct even when presented with evidence? The check and balance is not there.

1488,"I signed up for and began using a new US Bank checking account in XXXX XXXX. I was mostly pleased with the service. However, recently, I have noticed that I am being charged fees that I did not originally agree to when I signed up for services. I have contacted US Bank regarding these illegal fees, and they have chosen to ignore my messages.   To prove my point, I have uploaded images of the account sign up process, including all account agreements and pages wherein one signs up for an account, opts out of  overdraft coverage '' and enrolls in the  overdraft protection '' service. I uploaded the contents to a website currently under development, XXXX Such a comparison is probably too nice, however, because XXXX XXXX actually disclosed his fees in the agreement fine print ; US Bank, however, did not.   Inside the overdraft section of the account agreement it states :  ATM and Debit Card Overdraft Coverage : Certain accounts are subject to a consumer 's election/choice to opt-in to receive ATM and Debit Card Overdraft Coverage. '' ...  If you do not opt-in, we will not authorize payment of an ATM or everyday ( non-recurring ) debit card transaction that could result in an overdraft status. In limited circumstances, your ATM or every day debit card transaction may be processed and your account results in a negative available balance, even if you have not opted-in to overdraft coverage for these transactions. These situations may include, but are not limited to, debit card transactions that post that are processed by the merchant when the merchant does not first obtain an authorization from U.S. Bank. If this situation occurs, you will not be charged an Overdraft Paid Fee for paying the transaction if you have not elected to Opt-In to ATM and Debit Card Overdraft Coverage. '' The  overdraft solutions '' section of my online account has always stated that I have been opted out of  overdraft coverage '' this entire time, yet they have charged me several overdraft paid fees for ATM check ( debit ) card transactions.   Reviewing the entire account agreement does not reveal that the account owner must pay a {$36.00} overdraft paid fee ( when fully Opted Out of overdraft coverage and opted into overdraft protection ) for ATM and everyday check ( debit ) card transactions. The  overdraft protection '' section in the account agreement does not state that enrolling in  overdraft protection '' automatically enrolls one into or overrides the account owner 's  overdraft coverage '' choice, either.   After signing up for an account, if one  opts out '' of overdraft coverage and signs up for the  overdraft protection '' service ( XXXX ), they are led to believe that doing so will completely avoid {$36.00}  overdraft paid '' fees for ATM and everyday check card transactions. Under the  Overdraft Protection '' and  Opt-out '' columns in the  How much does it cost? '' ( XXXX ) row, no {$36.00} overdraft paid fees for ATM and everyday check ( debit ) card transactions are mentioned. It does, however, mention such a fee in the leftmost  Opt-In '' column for overdraft coverage. It is reasonable to infer that US Bank specifically chose to avoid mentioning the {$36.00} overdraft paid fees for ATM / debit card transactions in the  overdraft protection '' column as doing so would most certainly deter a large number of people, including myself, from signing up for the service.   However, avoiding mention of these fees is certainly illegal as they are not outlined anywhere during the account sign up process, account agreement or  overdraft solutions '' section.   Thus, it took me by complete surprise ( as it should have ) when I incurred XXXX {$36.00}  overdraft paid '' fees on XXXX XXXX after an {$85.00} charge was attempted on my debit card   ",lo31@purdue.edu,0

Today Bank of America refunded a {$70.00} payment to XXXX XXXX Bank. When I checked my account on XXXX/XXXX/16 I noticed it was at - {$11.00} with the XXXX XXXX XXXX Bank payments pending. Bank of America purposely sent up their withdraws and deposit purposely to benefit them. XXXX XXXX is set up for automatic withdraw. XXXX of their payments came through on XXXX and post on XXXX XXXX side on XXXX. Bank of America did not even begin to process theses till XXXX although they claimed to me today to do no work on the weekend. When I called Bank of America early XXXX they informed me my transfer from XXXX bank should post today the transfer amount was for {$13.00} this more than covered the difference. This morning I checked my account to see that Bank of America returned my {$70.00} payment to XXXX XXXX. They charged me a {$35.00} NSF fee for the returned payment and then posted my deposit on XXXX. Bank of America refused to return the fee even though their staff were the ones to inform me that the {$13.00} transfer would go through on Monday. If I had known then I could have easily made a deposit in the ATM if the transfer was not going to process. I am located in XXXX were Bank of America is headquartered I could have easily made a deposit at the XXXX of Bank of America locations in the city. Bank of America Deposit and charge policy is so selective their is absolutely no way to be prepared as a Bank member what they may or may not do.

On XXXX, XXXX, the local Chase Branch informed me that they have not been able to find my {$2100.00} and requested me to contact the sender to reissue me a new check without finding the ATM issue. This is unacceptable and irresponsible attitude towards this investigation and I can not accept their findings so far.   On XXXX/XXXX/XXXX, I went to the Chase bank to request them to access ATM to find my {$2100.00} check which was not successfully deposited due to ATM technical problem. The Branch Manager, XXXX XXXX XXXX, refused to access ATM for my check because I filed a claim over the phone and I also received the temporary credits provided by Chase on XXXX/XXXX/XXXX. I insisted on asking XXXX to check the ATM three times when I was there on XXXX/XXXX/XXXX, but she refused to do anything.   On XXXX/XXXX/XXXX, per my discussion with XXXX XXXX of Chase Executive Office over the phone, I have not obtained anything new from her and XXXX told me it would take 45 days till XXXX/XXXX/XXXX deadline for Chase to conduct their research and investigation without any detailed reasoning.   On XXXX/XXXX/XXXX, I spoke to XXXX at the local Chase branch office over the phone and he told me that he spoke to the Branch Manager, XXXX XXXX XXXX, and told me that they could not find my {$2100.00} check.   On XXXX/XXXX/XXXX, I went to Chase Branch and spoke to XXXX and showed him the ATM receipt that I obtained on XXXX/XXXX/XXXX. XXXX asked for another Chase bank rep to open the ATM and checked. As a result, they were still not able to locate the {$2100.00} check and asked me to contact the check sender to reissue me a new check as their resolution.  Chase would have more chances to find my {$2100.00} check when I was in the branch on XXXX/XXXX/XXXX, why did Chase Branch Manager refuse to access ATM at that time? Why did the Chase wait for two weeks to access the ATM on XXXX/XXXX/XXXX to try to look for check again? Why is the procedure to access ATM totally changed within two weeks on XXXX/XXXX/XXXX and XXXX/XXXX/XXXX? How could the {$2100.00} check disappeared without trace? Please request Chase Bank to show solid evidence with all of taped videos and ATM logs to investigate whether they have done proper procedures to protect customer 's assets and rights.   Furthermore, in XXXX XXXX XXXX, I had awful experience with the same local Chase Branch which is the closest Chase branch to where I live. The teller thought I occupied her time to deposit checks in the counter and asked me to do deposits at ATM. The teller seems she did not want to serve me. Due to this bad experience, I feel reluctant to go to the counter. That was why I deposited the check at ATM from time to time. Then the ATM got technical problem and swallowed my check on XXXX/XXXX/XXXX. Back in XXXX XXXX, I have filed a formal complaint to Chase Customer Service and I obtained a response from XXXX XXXX of Chase Executive Office dated on XXXX/XXXX/XXXX attached, which did not address my concerns/issues other than perform a formality.

I received no notice or notification about the change in my APY nor authorized the change with Santander or agreed to it.

I had trouble closing the accounts, as can be confirmed by multiple calls to the Citi customer service unit. Please note - there are NO branches in my state and it appears as though the branch I started the account in is closed as well. This is very unfair and confusing for a consumer. Eventually, the accounts were liquidated/closed. However, it appears as though what I thought was an available balance for me, was actually a line of credit. It was ~ {$150.00} ans was reported to the credit bureaus as delinquent. Now, my otherwise perfect credit history has been negatively impacted. Look, this was not a loan to me that I did n't repay. This was just a confusing feature on my account that I did n't even know existed. I was never notified - no one called me, no one mailed anything to me - regarding this ... it just showed up on my credit report one day. This is not an act of non-payment.

I met the requirements but did not receive the bonus. When I asked online customer service, they said I do not qualify for the promotion because I had closed my previous account at Suntrust within 180 days. This is completely different from what I was told on the phone in XX/XX/XXXX, just before I opened the current account. Back then the phone customer service told me that my previous account was closed over 6 months ago, and I would qualify for the promotion as long as I make the qualifying direct deposits within 60 days.   I sent a detailed email to a member of the Suntrust Executive team ( copy attached ), asking them to stand by the information I was given on the phone. In response they claimed  Our investigation was unable to find documentation showing that you were informed you would qualify for the promotion. '' I reiterated my position that the proof is in the phone conversation in XX/XX/XXXX, and requested them to review that call and award the bonus if my claim is correct, or provide me a copy/transcript of the call showing that my claim is incorrect.

Suntrust responded with an identical form letter ( even with the same date ), claiming that  Our investigation was unable to find documentation showing that you were informed you would qualify for the promotion ''. This indicates they either made no effort to locate the phone call, or they had located the call earlier and found that it corroborates my claim.

I have no control over that. There was no fraud on my end. No one claimed to be me, nor did they claim to be the payee. The check was stolen and Chase paid it without verifying they were the payee. This is their mistake, not mine.   I have called the Chase fraud department almost every week trying to come to a resolution, and they have no news or updates.

My XXXX mother in law asked me if I could go into the Wells Fargo bank and get change for a {$20.00} bill, as we had just dropped her dog off at a 'cash only ' groomer ; to which she did not have correct change for.  After observing the line and unable to quickly identify available seating for her, I sat her in a seat at the XXXX outside of the entrance, then I waited in line until a teller became available. The XXXX teller I worked with advised me he could not change my {$20.00} bill, unless I held an account with Wells Fargo.  I returned to my mother, and explained what occurred. She quickly handed me her ATM card, proudly stating that she has an account from her many years of service with Wells Fargo ( recently XXXX retiring, due to her XXXX only a few years earlier ) and asked me to return, while she continued to wait in her seat. I returned the bank, to wait back in the line as I was instructed. When a teller called me over, I presented the Well 's Fargo card I was asked to, so I could get change for my same {$20.00} bill. This teller appropriately asked for my mother in law ( as it was her account ), to which I advised she was near by, but was sitting as she is XXXX. The teller again reiterated that I would be unable to get the change unless I personally held an account with Wells Fargo. I then asked the teller if I was account holder with the bank would I be able to use the same {$20.00} bill I was presenting to obtain change? The teller advised me that she could, without issue. I then asked if my money held any value to them, being that I am not a current member of the bank. The teller clearly advised me that it does not. I then asked for her business card, as I was not happy with her explanation of the value of my money. I was receiving treatment as a XXXX class citizen, who 's money holds no value outside of the Wells Fargo. A XXXX teller quickly intervened, and advised me the same - that my money does not hold any value in his/the banks eyes, unless I personally have an account with Well Fargo. He then provided me his business card, as I left.  Are these deceptive practices in place to manipulate the public into opening accounts with the bank?  Would these same policies apply if I was a 10 year old child, who saved money in my piggy bank, and wanted to feel as an 'adult ' by placing a {$10.00} bill in my wallet, instead of carrying a change purse? I understand that I am not a 10 year old child, instead I am an adult, who holds many bank accounts at multiple other institutions, who was just simply trying to assist my XXXX mother in law as requested.  Luckily, I was able to go to the XXXX ( where my mother in law was sitting, as there was not seating clearly available for her at the Well 's Fargo branch for her to sit ) and they graciously assisted me in obtaining my change without any confrontation.  I found it entertaining that as we were leaving the store, I observed a young child ( about XXXX years old ) with his mother, asking the man servicing the XXXX XXXX machine outside of the bank entrance, if he could make change so that he could by a small trinket from the vending machine.

On XXXX XXXX, water pipes in the unoccupied house froze and burst with considerable damage. The sale was put on hold.  The seller filed an insurance claim and was awarded funds for repairs, which were deposited in the Insurance Claims Department of Chase Bank.  I renewed my offer. About half of the insurance repair work was completed at that point.

The remaining work was for mold remediation, floors and repair to the heating system. A total of {$14000.00} remained in the insurance claims benefit. At this point, my real estate agent informed me that it would be best to accept the remaining money rather than wait for the repairs to be completed because the house might be placed in foreclosure by Chase. With this understanding a new closing was set.  When we were assured the sale would take place I contacted a new firm to do the work needed for the insurance repairs along with other rehabilitation work on the house. The seller and his agent contacted Chase Bank to add my name to the account for the insurance claims benefits and I was told the bank agreed to this arrangement.

1724,I sell on XXXX. I have to use paypal as part of their requirements. Paypal when you purchase something takes the money immediately out of your bank account. However when depositing they take sometimes up to 6 days if it falls on a weekend. Then my credit union holds the money sometimes a day.

1761,"The loan system of TD Bank is very confusing. I was rejected today by TD bank to waive the late fee after my best effort to correct a late payment situation. I then realized that it is TD Bank 's deliberate intention to create this confusion to make extra profit by collecting late fees on customers. For a {$2400.00} tax escrow late payment, TD charges {$160.00}, which is 6.54 %.   Almost all other banks I have dealt with either send a coupon booklet for XXXX month payments or mail a monthly statement consisting of both loan and escrow payment. In contrast, TD Bank mails out XXXX separate statements with XXXX payments due monthly. The XXXX is the escrow statement every month around XXXX and due on the XXXX of the following month while XXXX statement is for interest and principal payment around end of the month and due on the XXXX of the following month. Meanwhile TD requires the borrower to maintain a checking account for TD 's direct withdrawal.   Ever since I had this loan at the XX/XX/XXXX, I have always made my payments on time. I usually set auto pay for the ones with coupon booklet. For those which do not send coupon booklet, I rely on their statement to pay my mortgage because the annually changed tax escrow amount. However, the past XXXX, for whatever reason I did not receive XXXX credit card statements and TD 's escrow statement on time. As soon as I was aware of the lateness, I contacted XXXX XXXX, my account manager from TD Bank. He advised me to pay personally at one of their branch. So I did and also established the auto transfer to my TD checking accounts according to my best estimate. From my track record, XXXX waived my late fee and interest immediately after I explained, but not the TD Bank.  Before TD turned down my request, XXXX XXXX arranged a meeting with me and expressed that TD will need more business to exchange for this waiver. At the same time he also agreed with me that TD 's XXXX a month loan statements are inefficient and confusing.  When I followed up with XXXX XXXX on XX/XX/XXXX, I was told that his supervisor rejected it because I have no potential profit to them. I am shocked that a world known bank would handle situation only based on interest instead of fairness and principle. I have been a manager in real estate business for XXXX years, never paid a late fee. All US banks small or large are very reasonable. They base your track record and allow you at least XXXX time late payment leeway. Nevertheless, the TD Bank refuses any refund for the bewildered system uniquely from all others regardless if you have been a good customer so that TD can easily earn the extra profit whenever an oversight happened. The late fee of {$160.00} was only for the lateness of the escrow. I wonder if I would be end up with another late fee of {$170.00} based on the same 6.54 % calculation if the XXXX part of payment which is for interest and principal of {$2700.00} was late. As a reference, I have a similar amount of loan with XXXX XXXX XXXX, its late fee for both loan and escrow is only {$87.00} per month.   If a huge corporation like TD Bank has some ethic value in this business, I believe TD should at least give its customers one chance to refund their hard earned money and more importantly correct its system to clarify its parts of duty.

1794,"XX/XX/XXXX/ XX/XX/XXXX- I incurred overdraft fees on my account. The bank would return a payment due to insufficent funds on one day/ charge a fee and then the next day approve the payment and charge an additional overdraft fee. This continued for serveral months. This caused large financial issue with my checking account. To the tune of having been assessed from XX/XX/XXXX to present a total of {$2500.00} in overdraft fees all to which have been paid. I have direct deposit and with each deposit the bank is paid for the fees in advance. In XX/XX/XXXX I was billed a total of {$770.00} in overdraft fees, XXXX {$210.00}, XX/XX/XXXX over {$200.00}, XX/XX/XXXX {$200.00}, XX/XX/XXXX {$140.00}, XX/XX/XXXX {$480.00}. I have attempted serveral times to speak with the bank about the fee assessment and have someone from the branch contact me. I was advised that someone would contact, I would get a telephoen call, would return the call and leave a message on their machine and receive no call back. The merchant in the past has done several things that indicate questionable business practices. For example during all of the fee assessments, there was an attempt for a merchant : XXXX, they were trying to collect on a late return of movies or no return. This merchant does get preauthorization with the initial rental. So when the movie is returned late or not at all they will go back into the credit card account used to rent to collect payment. I have recorded proof of a balance that was owed that the merchant attempted to withdraw {$60.00} ( approx ) with all of the fees I did not have enough. Ultimately, I only had {$11.00} ( approx ) in my checking account. The merchant miracously authorized the exact dollar amount. Then on the date of my deposit they come back into my account for the difference. I never contacted the merchant regarding the with draw or the authorization of a specific amount to resolve a balance. I was not aware that I had one with them assuming my children returned all the movies. The way it is discovered is that my account is impacted. The bank is double dipping and in the month of XX/XX/XXXX I suspect they were attempting to meet an end of the year quota, impact as may patrons during the XXXX Friday purchase/etc. I have been within the bank and heard that discussion. Also, I have had an incident where my account was compromised/debit card. Off of XXXX attempt with my card for a transaction out of the country they blocked my card. I was told I had to get a different checking account number. I proceeded via telephone and then went to the nearest branch facility and collected a new card. The branch of complaint. I am told at that time that I did not need to change my account but there was nothing they could do now that has been done. The account I was to have was to be identical to the existing account. Which was a grandfathered XXXX account which had no monthly fees regardless the balance. However that has not taken place, I get charged a monthly fee and they can not correct that either. So now along with the excessive fees they have imposed to my account I also now have monthly fees. This fees abuse has put me in financial straights. I stand to loose my residence, car because each month I am robbing XXXX to pay XXXX and the fees just keep coming as I try to get this under control.

1899,"In XXXX, I purchased a mobile home in XXXX XXXX, Louisiana. The home was originally financed, and subsequently paid off ( in approximately XXXX, as my own credit report does attest ), with XXXX XXXX. After submitting the final payment to XXXX, I did receive the paperwork and placed it as well as the cancelled check used to pay the last payment into safe keeping with my mother, because I was in the process of moving from the mobile home and into another house. Notwithstanding my naivety, that mobile home being my XXXX ever home purchase, I was ignorant to the fact that I alone was responsible for requesting that the lien be released, and no such instruction existed with the paperwork from XXXX. This did not become an issue until this year ( XXXX ), after laying either dormant or housing an occasional relative, a prospective buyer approached me, cash in hand and offering to buy it. Having no use for it and its age starting to show, I agreed on the spot for a mutually fair amount. Since I knew I owned it free and clear, I consented to the buyer moving it and we agreed that he would receive the title as soon as I could obtain the paperwork from my mother. Well, during the course of the deal, my mother 's apartment complex building burned to the ground, due to an electrical short per the Fire Marshall. Long story short, the  safe '' filing cabinet, and all but a few photos, was among the items that turned to magma by the time the blaze was brought under control and extinguished. However, in Louisiana, mobile homes are recorded with the DMV, because, since they can, in fact, be reverted back to a vehicle of sorts and possess a XXXX. Therefore, I went to my local DMV and requested both duplicates of the registration and title. It was at this time that I learned that the lien was still listed on the registration, and that until it is removed, a title can not be issued for the home.  Finally to the point ; to my surprise, it was NOT XXXX XXXX listed as the lien holder, but Bank of America, with whom I had never even dealt with regard to my home. I tried to contact the XXXX office in XXXX, MS , because that 's the address the DMV had on file, but that office had been liquidated. Then, when I contacted XXXX center, they had no previous record of the mortgage or it was  archived '' and unobtainable, and they recommended I contact BoA, which I did. BoA reps were very rude this time, and every instance thereafter, almost blatantly unhelpful in trying to help me resolve the issue. The only half-way useful information they have rendered, to date, is that my mortgage was likely acquired with thousands of others from GTF, and that it just happened that I had already made my final payment GT, who provided my docs, but that BoA actually had gained the asset.  BoA, upon running my social in their system, they concluded that they had never heard of me or the property, or it was /drum roll ... .ARCHIVED, and unobtainable, stating that if all I had was the registration and ID and that it would be insufficient documentation ... so, good luck with that ... bye! So, I called the FDIC, who instructed me to go to a BoA branch, with my registration, and have the manager place a call directly to the lien release department for BoA.  About a month ago, I visited the BoA branch in XXXX, TX, as instructed. A supervisor agreed to and did place the call in my presence, and three weeks ago was the last time I heard from the XXXX contact. I totally believe I am being avoided if my number appears on the Caller ID. The FDIC then forwarded me to a comptroller, who forwarded me to the top of BoA ( again rude and unhelpful ), and then to YOU as a backup plan.

1903,"Hello, I was a named party in a class-action suit against a former employer. My attorney was able to reach an individual settlement for the named parties, and I received XXXX checks for my share of the settlement. I deposited the checks into my personal checking account with Wells Fargo via ATM, and within the next week my account was locked as the checks were BOTH reported  confirmed counterfeit '' by the issuing bank ( XXXX XXXX XXXX ). This was back in XXXX. I called my attorney, and he checked with the other named party, and their checks went through just fine.   I tried to have my attorney tell the defendant to cancel the checks and issue new ones. Well, it turns out that my bank ended up collecting the money from the checks even though they were confirmed counterfeit. So the defendant refused to issue new checks, since the money was withdrawn from their account. Fair enough.   My bank refused to listen to me. I brought in the settlement documents, I called and spoke to the Manager 's Manager 's Manager 's Manager, still no luck. According to them, the defendant 's bank is STILL calling the checks counterfeit. They claim that the funds are in the process of being recalled back to the defendant 's bank account. Meanwhile, the settlement checks were reported onto my IRS transcripts, so I had to file an extension on my taxes until this whole thing gets resolved.   Here 's my issue : Since XXXX, I 've lost my checking account, my savings account, and the few hundred bucks that was in my checking account when I deposited the checks. My auto insurance payment bounced, and then I had to pay that on the same paycheck as my car payment, and it took some time to recover. The funds are STILL in the process of being recalled, but I 'm still over here floating in the wind. Is there any way I can get this resolved? Is the defendant liable for these ( admittedly minor ) damages over the past five months? I do n't even care about suing for these damages, I really just want to get my proper settlement checks and resolve this issue for good. My attorney claims that there 's nothing more his firm can do to help ( he got his check ), but he suggested that I might hire an attorney to file a breach of contract claim against the defendant.   I believe that the checks were reported counterfeit because the ATM faded out the ink on my larger check. I 've attached printouts of each check from XXXX 's own computer system. I 've also attached a copy of my attorney 's check, which is from the same account as my larger check. I 'm unable to make any progress with either bank, and I would rather not have to take any legal action.   ",zhan1345@purdue.edu,0
1912,"Because I 've had a history of making small purchases with my debit card ( like a {$2.00} cup of coffee ) that later ends up costing me more than XXXX the amount paid XXXX when a check posts but the small purchase  bounces '' despite having been authorized at the point of sale XXXX, I decided a few years back to decouple my accounts. Now, I have XXXX checking accounts, XXXX with the same bank. XXXX account is linked to the debit card I use regularly to make purchases and is also the account that my paycheck is deposited into. The other account I use to write checks from. Every XXXX weeks when I get paid, automatic transfers kick over into the XXXX account the exact amount for each check I write. For example, if I 'm writing a check for {$70.00}, then {$70.00} is transferred into that account. When it hits XXXX every other week, I 'm happy because it means everything balanced. But a few weeks ago my account went under by a penny. Sometime ago I enrolled my  check-paying '' checking account in for the bank 's keep the change program. ( I had also requested a XXXX debit card for this XXXX checking account to pay recurring bills each month like XXXX ; despite being processed with a visa card number, the bank treats them like checks. If they bounce a fee is assessed. ) {$7.00} for XXXX posted and the bank transferred {$0.00} into my savings account. I do n't ever recall this being a problem in the past, but this time a  penny saved '' meant I was a  penny short. '' My account did n't have enough funds to cover a check for {$40.00}. The bank honored the check anyway, but socked me with a {$35.00} fee because my account was {$0.00} short. XXXX cent!   I was charged {$35.00} because I was a penny short. This is grossly disproportionate.   I called to speak with customer service. The gentleman I spoke with agreed that it seemed unfair but was unable to have the fee refunded. He put me on hold while he spoke with a supervisor. After about XXXX minutes, the line went dead. I did n't have time to call back and thought ( XXXX ) that the bank would follow-up internally and refund the fee. I was wrong because the {$35.00} then had a domino effect because of the automatic transfer system I set up. I transferred more money to cover some of the costs, but two weeks later another check two weeks later was short by {$2.00}. The bank again honored that check but again assessed an insufficient funds fee of {$35.00}. When a week passed ( I get paid every XXXX weeks and live outside the XXXX so depositing money into my account requires either mailing a money order or sending it via XXXX XXXX XXXX but the red was not brought out of the black, the bank charged a {$35.00} extended overdrawn balance charge. So, in a sense, being a penny short cost me {$100.00}.   This will probably happen again because despite being a XXXX I live paycheck as a government employee. I am crippled with debt : student loan debt, remaining balances on closed credit cards, tax debt from my once-upon-a-time XXXX gig, as well as day-to-day expenses. So that light, I appreciate that the bank honored checks I wrote when it could have just refused them. But I do n't understand why a bank has the right to make this choice. If there is n't enough money in the account, then the check should be refused. Or, if the bank does decide to honor a check for which there is n't sufficient funds at that moment, it should just honor it : trust that ( based on the account 's history or account holder 's history XXXX the funds will be there shortly. But a bank should not be permitted to have the choice if the choice means they get to sock their customers with multiple fees. And even if a bank is permitted to honor a check and then assess a fee for being nice, so to speak, the fee should at least be proportionate. I was short a penny and was charged {$35.00} XXXX {$100.00} was the total effect ). That is a grossly disproportionate ratio.   ",ahbruns@purdue.edu,0

[ The branch advisor said this would be not be a problem, after I questioned if such a large check deposit could cause any unnecessary red flags, since my typical deposits were historically much lower ]. On XXXX XXXX, I attempted to log into my online banking that I discovered it to be inaccessible. I quickly called customer service and they told me the accounts were  in the process of being closed as of XX/XX/XXXX '', and subsequently transferred to the Risk Management department. Risk management manager ( XXXX XXXX ) said that the bank was  at no duty to disclose the nature of the situation '' since it was  in the contractual agreement at the time of account opening ''. He informed me that the check had been returned to the maker, and, upon my questioning the status of the little personal money I had in both accounts, said that they are available for withdrawal for the time being, but may be put on hold tomorrow ( XXXX XXXX ), and suggested I withdraw the funds as soon as possible. At this point I was visibly frustrated. I had made a special point to make sure all documents and procedures ( such as opening my XXXX, going in person ( instead of online ) to open the accounts, etc ) were conducted according to protocol. The call ended on XXXX, XXXX XXXX, at which point I took XXXX advice to withdraw all the funds from both accounts at a nearby branch. In the following days, the bank issued no explanation or assistance in resolving the matter, simply stating it has decided to  end the banking relationship '' with me. The investor who wrote the check quickly contacted her own bank ( XXXX ), and was told that the check could now be cashed since she has verified it. XXXX things. 1 ) I do n't have the original check anymore and 2 ) It 's too late because both my accounts are closed. All along, I 've been following the exact instructions given by the bank 's very own employees, and the result almost gave me a XXXX XXXX. Now that a week has passed, and countless hours of personal investigation conducted, it dawns on my that I must take a stand for such seemingly arbitrary behavior by Bank of America. While the employees at my local branch are respectful, the explanations they receive from the back office are inadequate at best. If the situation resolves without further incident, I will simply take my business elsewhere. However, if ( from my research ), my personal banking record becomes tarnished from this baseless situation, it is without choice that I take full legal action to the extent of the law, given that I will not let Bank of America 's incompetent risk management department wrongfully suspect me of conducting anything other than a wholly legitimate business entity with the sole purpose of helping my closest friends, family, and university peers generate consistent returns in the equity markets. To assume otherwise is truly insulting to my reputation, dignity, and faith in the capital markets system, one that I remain a strong supporter of given my education at one of the top universities in the world.

1976,"This is the XXXX complaint that I have filed against Capital One Bank during the last 57 days. For information regarding my initial complaint, which also involved my Rewards Money Market account ( hereafter, RMMA ), please see Case XXXX ( hereafter, Case XXXX ).   A brief summary of the facts associated with Case XXXX will facilitate CFPB 's understanding of my current complaint:1 ) After making a {$230000.00} deposit to my RMMA in XX/XX/XXXX, I had, as of XX/XX/XXXX, not received reward points for the month of XXXX. Historically, Capital One Bank credited reward points to my RMMA within the XXXX five days of the new month.   2 ) When I contacted Capital One, they cited a  bank wide system issue '' as the reason for the delay in reward points posting to my account, a claim reiterated in a letter, dated XX/XX/XXXX, that I received after this issue was resolved.   3 ) This letter also stated that the computer issue lasted from XXXX XXXX - XX/XX/XXXX. Note that Case XXXX was actually filed two days after ( XXXX XXXX ) the computer issue that effected RMMAs was resolved. Yet reward points were not posted to my account until ~ XXXX XXXX and Capital One backdated this posting to XX/XX/XXXX.   4 ) Finally, I know another individual who has a RMMA and he/she received his/her reward points during the XXXX five days of XXXX ( Note XXXX, below ). This fact appears to be inconsistent with a  bank wide system issue '' - if the issue was  system wide, '' presumably all RMMA accounts were effected, right?   Onto my current submission:1 ) On XX/XX/XXXX, I received an unsigned, undated notice from Capital One Bank informing me that my RMMA was being closed.   2 ) The notice did n't quite put it that way : instead, it stated that my ability to earn rewards points in my RMMA would end on XX/XX/XXXX and that the funds in the RMMA would be swept into a High Yield money market account in XX/XX/XXXX.   3 ) I received this notice 53 days after Case XXXX was opened. Retaliation for contacting the CFPB?   4 ) This notice arrived after a period ( XX/XX/XXXX-XX/XX/XXXX ) in which I had redeemed a high number ( Note XXXX, below ) of rewards points ( XXXX ). Possibly, Capital One 's attitude towards RMMA holders is,  Please, send us your money, because if you do then you 'll earn reward points (! ) but if you actually use a lot of these points in a short period of time, well, that will make us sad and we will close your account in order to foreclose the possibility of future sadness.  In terms of outcomes, I would prefer to leave my funds in my RMMA and continue to earn rewards points. Hence, I have XXXX questions for Capital One : 1 ) Are all RMMAs like the one I hold being closed on XX/XX/XXXX? 2 ) If not, then why, exactly, is my RMMA being closed?   Note 1 - I omitted this information from Case XXXX because I had not received permission from my friend to include it in that filing. Understand that my friend 's points posted the XXXX five days of XXXX - they appeared in his/her account during this period. In contrast, my points did not post until ~ XXXX XXXX and were backdated to XX/XX/XXXX by Capital One.   Note 2 - By  high, '' I mean relative to my perception of my annual spending on my Capital One Visa, which runs around {$16000.00}. A brief explanation is required : the rewards points referenced above are earned in a money market account offered by Capital One Bank. I typically transfer these points to my Capital One Visa rewards account, where I use them to offset travel ( airline tickets, hotel ) purchases.   ",boyle20@purdue.edu,1
1978,"My account was overdrawn, however I made a return to a store. When I checked my account to see if the credit had posted, I found that Suntrust had applied an extended overdraft fee.

I have been a customer of Suntrust bank since 2010, and have direct deposit set up on my account.  I went to the bank to speak with a representative and let him see the copy of my credit from the store. He said that it was pending, but he could not make the decision to issue a refund of the fee as a courtesy. He would email his manager, and his manager would make a decision upon his return. XXXX days later, the manager, XXXX XXXX, called me and informed me that because of my returned item ( an insurance check that automatically is paid from my account ), the overdraft was my fault and the bank was right in charging me the fees. He rudely hung up the phone as I tried to discuss my concerns. To have an extended overdraft fee is an excessive fee, which makes it more difficult for consumers to gain financial stability. My account was overdrawn by {$11.00}, I was charged a returned item fee of {$36.00}, then an additional extended overdraft fee of {$36.00}.   This practice should not continue, and Suntrust should issue refunds of the extended overdraft fees.   ",li470@purdue.edu,0

I was given a supervisor who worked with me to allow two charges to be reprocessed, but also told me my newspaper subscription attempt had been declined overnight, and contacting the newspaper to recharge would have been time consuming - she wanted to get me my new card  overnight. '' I asked WHO used my card or attempted to use it, and/or which company that I trusted with this information was breached or hacked. Even when I was given to a supervisor I was told Citizens had no information, that XXXX was the entity directing the card be cancelled and replaced. Before I hung up, I asked about another account with the bank and was told that THAT debit card - a second card with a second account - was ALSO  flagged '' to be replaced.   I contacted XXXX and was told that they could connect me to Citizens to explain how the cards were compromised. Citizens blames XXXX, XXXX blames Citizens and I ca n't learn the manner my account information was  compromised '' and in what way. I understand that hackers break into banks and vendors and steal numbers. I want to know WHICH bank or vendor was vulnerable. I believe it 's my right to know ; that if I am to be careful or cautious I have a right to know how this happened. Furthermore, if we are looking at patterns here, it will keep happening and when it does, I want to know when, who, and how.  I am asking that your agency direct XXXX or Citizens, XXXX responsible for my accounts, to give me this information. I believe there needs to be clear policy about these situations. As the person who is trusting these entities, I have a right to know when the trust is violated. I am providing you with scans of the two cards that were canceled. If you need my bank account numbers, I am happy to provide those numbers. I am also writing to my senators and congressman to ask them to consider some sort of legislation that provides us with the ability to access this information without spending hours on the phone and resorting to complaints.  I spoke with my AG 's office and their Division of Banks and was told that if it was a bank they regulated, I could file a complaint and the bank would then be compelled to give me the information. I hope the process is the same here.  I understand that the companies involved are concerned about their reputations, but as the consumer, I believe I have - or should have - the right to know.

Because my friend and I had been given only one key for our room the night before, I called the front desk to learn if I could remain a second day in the same room.

'' I assumed that meant that the hotel was offering it to me gratis for the problems of the previous night with the room key, so I planned to stay the second day. ( The key is needed to operate the elevator and electricity in the room as well as the door. ) There were additional problems when the telephone in the room later that day when the telephone stopped working. The room charge was $ XXXX/night.   In emails with the general manager of the hotel, I was given only {$100.00} credit for the key problem. ( He claimed that the telephone was working although several members of the hotel staff knew otherwise, and a friend who tried to call me were told the phone was told my phone was not working. ) I thought he should keep the promise and give me a night gratis. If I had not been offered the second night for free, I would not have remained at the hotel, as I called in the early afternoon and I could have checked out without incurring the additional charge.   I called Chase and told the story to the telephone rep requesting one night free. The Chase rep, however, suggested that I should ask for both nights free and promised to advocate on my behalf. She said she would be getting back to me for more information. I told her I had several emails with the general manager, which she asked me to save.   I was very disappointed to receive a letter from Chase a few days later denying my claim. No one contacted me as I was promised to ask for evidence or if I might accept a refund for the single night which I had tried to request. I would have to be satisfied with the {$100.00} I had been given.   I called and spoke to a supervisor but was told that there was nothing I could do. The decision was final, because of some law they sited. The reason is because a telephone, which was not really relevant to the hotel 's promise of the free room ( it was the missing door key the night before ), apparently the telephone is seen as a luxury. Lacking a room phone, therefore, and is not seen as a reason for a refund. I argued and argued, but nothing can be done. I have stayed at hotels all around the world. The rooms always have a telephone. When mine did not work, I did not stay in the hotel that night. After I finished my very late dinner, I stayed with a friend who lived nearby, saving the hotel some money for the early check out.   But my issue is with Chase.

2484,"Under the Deceptive Trade Practices Act, Scottrade Inc. was found liable for misrepresentation of material facts that resulted in losses to individual investors such as myself and many others. Scottrade 's negligence and omission of material information pertaining to the sale of known harmful securities to the public is not only highly unethical but bordering criminal activity due to its commission structure that encourages such activities to occur at the great expense of hard-working ordinary investors who have saved up all their life only to lose it all to somebody who took advantage of the system.   Scottrade needs to be sued and ordered to pay compensatory damages to victims as well as punitive fines for violations of securities regulations. Otherwise, more ordinary individual investors and naive investors will lose their hard-earned money to Scottrade 's deceptive practices, material omissions, misrepresentations, and negligence.

2487,"I decided to invest my money with Raymond James in XXXX, 2015, due to the guarantee of protection that I would be getting with my investment. My financial advisor at Raymond James informed me that he could not provide better returns then what I was seeing on my own but what he could do is promise me protection from any major loss if the market was to go into a tailspin. His investment strategy he was proposing was to set Stop Losses in my plan to make sure I got out of the market at 10 % loss if the market was ever to have a major drop in the market. He could not believe that I had no protection built into my current plan that would protect me from a catastrophic loss and what he could offer me was peace of mind and a guarantee that even in the worst of times I would not suffer more than a 10 % loss due to the protection that he would put in place with his investment strategy. I believe the Stop Loss investment strategy was not properly explained because this strategy did the opposite of protection and caused me to have a major loss. NO RISK was even mentioned. I should have never been promised protection if that was not true. The sales pitch I was given was based 100 % on protection. When the market dropped on XXXX XXXX my account was traded at 40 % below the market in some cases. The value of my account dropped by over XXXX. My advisor said that it was not his fault and this has never happened before. I should have never been sold a guarantee of protection if this was not true. My advisor should not have had me invested in XXXX 's that were not liquid and difficult to find a buyer in a down market. I feel Raymond James and my financial advisor are responsible for my loss by their negligence to understand the inherit risk of an investment plan based on Stop Losses, to properly inform me of the risk involved, to have invested my money in XXXX 's that were not very liquid, and to promise protection from a loss of greater than 10 % and yet I suffered losses of 40 % below the market. The response I 'm getting from Raymond James is not acceptable when they are supposed to stand behind their promise of protection and integrity. They empathize with my situation but say the trades were valid trades even though the orders were filled at prices lower than the sop amount limit was set for.   ",boyle20@purdue.edu,1

It 's only {$100.00} in fees to be fair but it is so clearly a breach of the  Credit Card Act of 2009 '' and so I felt an obligation to call attention to it.   Where the breach legally occurred : Credit Card Act of 2009, section 7. As follows :  ( 7 ) RESTRICTION ON FEES CHARGED FOR AN OVER-THE-LIMIT TRANSACTION. -- With respect to a credit card account under an open end consumer credit plan, an over-the-limit fee may be imposed only once during a billing cycle if the credit limit on the account is exceeded ... '' This was done twice.   And Section 1 as follows :  no such fee shall be charged, unless the consumer has expressly elected to permit the creditor, with respect to such account, to complete transactions involving the extension of credit under such account in excess of the amount of credit authorized. '' I did not, and I opted out of their overdraft already.   Furthermore, section 2 as follows : ' ( 2 ) DISCLOSURE BY CREDITOR. -- No election by a consumer under paragraph ( 1 ) shall take effect unless the consumer, before making such election, received a notice from the creditor of any over-the-limit fee in the form and manner ... '' Pertaining to re-ordering transactions, regulations section XXXX as follows : ' ( B ) [ Law shall ] prevent unfair or deceptive acts or practices in connection with the manipulation of credit limits designed to increase over-the-limit fees or other penalty fees.

Once I changed my account to a standard level ( because I was n't meeting the minimum dollar amount in the account ), many things began to go wrong.

It was n't until I received a statement in the mail for XXXX XXXX XXXX - XXXX XXXX XXXX ( see attached ) for {$22.00} for a purchase at  XXXX Web XXXX XXXX '', that I decided to close my final HSBC credit card account. I called HSBC asking first, why this charge was n't blocked ( I do not live in XXXX nor have I been there in the past year ), why it was n't detected as fraud, and why I was n't notified. While speaking on the phone, the representative proceeded to tell me she saw there were several attempted charges in the past two weeks in XXXX, and some at XXXX here in the XXXX. She asked me if any of them were me. I said no, I do not live there and I never shop at XXXX. I was concerned because no one had contacted me about the attempted use of the card in different locations. I asked her to please close to card for me over the phone. She told me it could n't be done because they had to investigate the {$22.00} charge first. Unhappily I agreed to wait. Instead of closing the account ( ending in XXXX ) permanently like I had asked her to, the representative decided to send me a new card with a new account ( ending in XXXX, opened end of XXXX XXXX ). One week later, they sent me some papers to fill out and send back to them regarding the fraud claim form ( see attached ) which I did. When I realized she had opened a new account for me I called and asked her to close it, again and instructed her not to reopen another card. After being hung up on, and transferred to different departments several times, I finally got someone on the line who was willing to close the account for me.

2642,"Over the past month I have written many complaints against Key Bank. I am writing this last complaint to simply sum up the issues that I have with this bank. I hope that the bank will be audited for excessive overdrafting again in the future. I had XXXX accounts with Key Bank, a personal checking account and a Hassle Free account. The Hassle Free account was attached to my personal checking account as an account that my teenaged son could use. He is a XXXX since he was just turning XXXX. The Hassle Free account issued a debit card with his name and I was able to transfer funds from my account to his account easily. Often, I would get very close to a XXXX balance as I live pay check to paycheck. Often I would deposit money through an ATM machine which would theoretically give me access to XXXX dollars immediately. However, through Key Bank 's magical accounting system, when the ledger would be managed by the bank, items would bounce because actually there was not immediate access to the money through the on line account.   I have several copies of my account and my son 's account as the bank was performing its processing during the evening and night hours. Often, the ledger shows a huge negative balance while the processing is happening. It 's hard to understand how a large modern bank like this has such antiquated accounting processes. I have an account in another bank and all transactions are immediate and neat. There is no messy, convoluted, unclear and dishonest practice that results in excessive overdrafts.   Anyway, the result of my complaining was that Key Bank closed my checking account. I did not ask for this. This created complete havoc in my financial life. I had to stop direct deposits and go to another bank to open an account for me and my son. When I talked to XXXX the representative of Key Bank who closed my account she did not even understand that the Hassle Free Account was my son 's and was connected to my personal account. She was going to leave the Hassle Free account open. So not only does key bank participate in magical accounting that results in excessive overdrafts for folks, but key bank also does not pay attention to its costumers and participates in retribution.   Lastly, for the years that I was involved with this bank, items would sit in the pending section of the account. Sometimes items would sit there for 10 days. But since Key Bank decided to close my account, items cleared within one day, even those items that were charged against the account by my son who is in another city. This shows that Key Bank purposefully leaves items in pending after which they reorder the debits to put the account in negative status.   I know that my complaining as I have could make me seem crazy and also that folks could argue that I do not manage my money well. But I represent many people who have no assets and who live pay check to pay check. This bank is notorious for these practices that I have highlighted over the last two months. I hope that at some point, Key Bank will be held accountable for their dishonesty and poor customer service. In the last year, I have paid the good part of XXXX $ in over draft fees. I do not have that money to give to Key Bank. XXXX the customer service rep said that she valued my patronage. Well, if that were true, then I would have had the overdraft fees refunded to me as I requested and Key Bank would not have tried to punish me by closing my account.   ",ahbruns@purdue.edu,1

I received an email with what was supposed to be the proper paperwork, but it was only for XXXX. The next day I received another email with a form which I assumed was for XXXX, but it was also for XXXX. Once again, I called the customer service number and spoke with a woman.

I asked her what the amount was for the new consolidated loan, and she told me it was {$320000.00}! I was shocked, as this amount was twice as much as I had borrowed. She placed me on hold and when she returned, she said that they had another customer with my exact same name and exact same account number with the amount she had quoted me earlier. She told me that my loans had NOT been consolidated. She claimed to have resolved the issue and everything would be fine from here on out. Naturally, I was skeptical. So I sent an email to a customer service rep that I had been dealing with asking to send me XXXX ACH enrollment forms ; XXXX for each of my loans. From there on out, I began dealing with a man by the name of XXXX XXXX. He sent me an email with ACH enrollment forms which I completed and returned to him along with XXXX voided checks. He also asked me to send him XXXX separate emails, XXXX for each account with the following information : o Customer Name and Account Number ; o Customer 's Check Number ; o Amount of payment ; o Effective date of payment ; o Bank Name ; o XXXX Number ; o XXXX Number When I had completed all of that, I assumed I was finished. However, I received another email from XXXX XXXX about a month later stating that he had sent me the wrong form and that I needed to fill out another form. Once again, this form was for only XXXX loan and not XXXX. The email was addressed to XXXX XXXX ( My name is XXXX XXXX ), so I assumed that he had sent it to the wrong person. I replied to the email asking him if he had indeed sent it to the wrong person and asked for reassurance that the money was being automatically withdrawn from my account each month. He replied to the email stating that it had not. By now I had been dealing with this mess for over 4 months. I needed to speak with him personally and I could n't reach him by phone. I eventually became so busy that I forgot about the matter. A few months later, I was notified that my accounts had gone into default.

When no credit I called back and some of their answers were  oh, we did n't have your street address ; oh, it shows resolved ; oh it shows you ca n't go back to your original card because your card is a STAR card. I called my paycard banking institution and they stated they are NOT a STAR card. I called Pay Pal back and I got the same run around. After that they locked me out of my account for 4 hours.

I was also emailing ebay and the vendor. They all pointed fingers at each other and blamed each other just as such as fraudsters do. I told them I would report them to the FTC and FCC and they said GO AHEAD. I in no way upon purchasing my item agreed if you have a return it goes to pay pal.

2841,"After my debit card and a book of checks were stolen, I called and had my card canceled and a freeze added to my checking account. A little while later I went to a branch of my bank and they began the process of switching me to a new checking account number. Because of the conversation and a few other past issues with the bank, I decided to close my checking account and find a new bank.  I visited the Wells Fargo website for information about closing accounts and was told it needed to have a zero balance in order to process. I transferred the remaining funds in the checking account to my Wells Fargo savings account and went to a different branch, XXXX closer to my office.  There, a very nice banker told me he could close my savings account ( the XXXX with the transferred checking funds ) but had to wait a day to close the checking account because of pending transactions. He showed me where my checkings account had a zero balance, with the XXXX pending transactions included. We closed savings and I called the next morning to the Wells Fargo customer service line to close checking ( because the website says that 's possible ).  Instead, I was told those XXXX pending items had n't cleared - even though all XXXX were conducted by noon the previous day and the bank 's policy is to post transactions made by XXXX on a business day by XXXX. XXXX of the transactions were with the bank, including removing a small amount of cash and moving some checking funds to my linked XXXX credit card.  I was told the process could be finished by XXXX meaning I could call after lunch and close the final account.  But I checked the account after lunch to confirm the pending items were posted so I could close the account and an overdraft charge was added to the checking account for transferring all the funds out to my savings.  I spoke with a customer service representative who said he could do nothing because the overdraft charge was justified, even though my account was zeroed out in order to close it the day before and nothing else posted.  I went to the branch that helped me the day before and the banker that helped me was the XXXX to assist me again. He called his supervisor over and told him my account was rightfully at {$0.00} the day before. The supervisor looked at my account and agreed it was n't right. He tried to remove the overdraft charge, but the systems were n't working and told me I would have to go to another branch the next day to make sure it was removed and my balance was back at {$0.00}.  Those XXXX pending transactions were all made well before the cutoff the day before, but the customer service representative said she ca n't close a XXXXbalance account with the pending accounts ( including the XXXX done with the bank ). But the transfer of checking funds to my savings account, which was done at XXXX., was posted - not pending, and I find that suspect.  Now I 'm having to go to the bank again - on a weekend - to see if they processed the overdraft refund and if my pending transactions are finally posted, a full day after they were supposed to be.  I have not done anything with my account as far as spending or transferring funds other than those transactions, yet by not posting them in a timely manner, I 'm being held hostage with this account and incurring fees that are not justified.  The bank has not followed it 's own policy for posting transactions to customer accounts, they are levying bogus charges and then their own staff members are admitting it 's not correct. I have been hung up on by a customer service supervisor today, I have more waiting and travel tomorrow to ensure they 've fixed another of their mistakes, and I am being told every time I contact them it 's either  not their problem '' or their systems are down again and I can not close my account with a {$0.00}.

2847,"On XXXX XXXX, 2015 I used my Wells Fargo ATM card to withdraw {$200.00}. Instead of issuing me the money, the ATM shut down, but did deduct {$200.00} from my checking account. That day, I filed a complaint via WF customer service ( telephone ). I was told my complaint would be settled in 3 days. After 3 days I called and was told it would take 10 days. After 10 days I spoke to WF 's ATM Manager and she said the investigation could take 45 days -- or longer. She basically accused me of trying to defraud Wells Fargo and when I asked if she considered me a criminal, she was silent. She was so abusive that I expected the police to ring my doorbell any day and arrest me! The Wells Fargo ATM Manager is an exceedingly rude, belligerent bully. Because of her -- after being a customer for 35 years! -- I decided to close my Checking Account and went to my local branch at XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX where I spoke to Service Manager XXXX XXXX.   This was on XXXX XXXX, 2015. XXXX XXXX told me that because WF has issued me a  temporary credit '' of {$200.00} while it investigated my ATM claim, I could not close my account. On XXXX XXXX I wrote WF CEO XXXX XXXX a letter explaining what happened and telling him that WF was holding my checking account hostage ( not allowing me to close it ) and I offered to let him keep the disputed {$200.00} -- just let me close my account!!! He did not respond. Around XXXX XXXX, I received a letter from WF saying the company was still researching my complaint. On XXXX XXXX, I sent another letter to XXXX telling him again that I want to close my account, and I included a check for the disputed {$200.00} hoping that would induce him to allow me to close my account. Did n't happen.   Around XXXX XXXX, I received a letter saying that the claim was finalized on XXXX XXXX in my favor. With that notice Wells Fargo was, in my opinion, admitting that I am not the criminal that the ATM manager called me. I did not try to defraud the company, something I knew all along.   At the end of XXXX, I received a call and letter from XXXX XXXX, ATM/Debit Card Executive Office. We spoke around XXXX XXXX. I told her I want to close my checking account and asked if I could do it over the phone. She said yes and put me in touch with someone who took all of my information and said I would receive a check for the remaining balance in the account ( {$1500.00} ) within five days. I just looked at my account online a few minutes ago and it appears not to have been closed and the {$1500.00} remains in my account -- unreachable by me. If I try to write a check against the {$1500.00}, WF may claim that I knowingly wrote a check against a closed account, even though the account appears to be open. So the money just sits in the account, frozen in time.   What must I do to close my checking account with Wells Fargo?

2948,"To start, I have repeatedly asked Wells Fargo reps to opt me out of overdraft protection ( as I had been repeatedly enrolled into it automatically ). This finally happened last year when I was told that occasionally charges would still go through ( due to  systemic '' issues ), and if that were to happen, I should come into the branch to get any overdraft charges reversed. This happened once on XXXX, three times on XXXX, and twice on XXXX. I went into the bank to get these overdraft charges reversed and was told something new, that overdraft protection only applies to charges that are made from my debit/credit card and not to charges routed through the bank account like checks. Since the charges were made from my XXXX card, which routes through my bank account, my account was overdrawn. Additionally, after Wells Fargo initially approved the charges ( against what I had been told would happen ), they then cancelled the payment the following day. When I asked why the bank first approved the payment and then cancelled it, I was told by a rep that Wells Fargo  tries to be helpful '' by  giving me until the end of the day to cover the cost of the charge. '' When I said that first approving the charge and then cancelling it was not helpful ( I would have no reason to put money into the account if it is not supposed to be overdrawn, and in this case I was not notified that an overdraft charge was approved until the next day ) I was told,  That is how banks work. '' When I pressed on this issue, and asked why does n't this bank just not approve charges if there is no money in the account, I was told  That is just not Wells Fargo 's policy. '' It got even worse from here - after Wells Fargo initially approved and then cancelled the payment, XXXX ran the same XXXX transactions, which were again approved, again incurred fees, and again cancelled at the end of the day.

3067,"My complaint is agents 5th 3erd Bank I have the bank on line option with my checking accounts, I do n't understand nor can I ever get an explanation on why my account on line seldom reflects the actual balance in my account. I have received many overdraft charges for this reason. On Monday XXXX XXXX I deposit my pay check for XXXX, on that day my balance said I had XXXX ( the deposit takes 24 hours to credit my account ) so I have XXXX, plus XXXX pending. I make XXXX credit card payments that equal XXXX. On Tuesday XXXX XXXX I check my account and I 'm overdrawn XXXX. My rent check had been deposited on Monday by my landlord, but it did not get proses until Monday night, it was for XXXX, now what I do n't understand is if my credit card payments and my rent check were proses on Monday night and I had XXXX plus XXXX pending, how could I be overdrawn? How is it that my online account knows I have XXXX pending but my actual account does not? They intentionally ignore the deposit that is going into the account, hit me with XXXX overdraft charges, then suddenly credit the deposit and withdrawal the service charges. How is it that they never credit the pending deposit first?  My on line account knows that there is a pending deposit it shows me on my on line account, I feel that 5th 3erd does this totally on purpose to charge me an overdraft charge.  I hope you can understand what I 'm saying, I 'm not the only person that sees this, that Bank has hundreds of complaints against it. Pleas help they have taken hundreds of dollars from me this way and it just does n't seem fair, they mislead or blog face lie via the on line banking.   ",afrances@purdue.edu,0
3070,"I got a notice about some unusual activity on an account that I set up for my younger brother to pay his expenses while in college, basically transferring all the money electronically to a different account through a program called XXXX. After confirming that it was n't initiated by my brother ( it was not ), I called and immediately asked for a hold to be placed. For this, I was charged {$30.00} which pushed the account into overdraft, but I was not worried, because I was assured the money would be returned in short order. Fast forward to 4 days, the transaction clears, to my incredulity, for which I was charged an additional overdraft fee. Furthermore, a number of transactions for very minimal accounts were in processing PRIOR to this transaction being posted and I was charged an overdraft fee for all of them. Finally, the bank decides to decline a transaction from paypal for {$9.00} and {$5.00}, respectively. I was charged a {$35.00} NSF fee for each transaction. As if this were not insulting enough, XXXX and the bank then proceeded to recharge, and return those transactions a stunning XXXX times, charging a {$35.00} fee on each occurrence. What should have been {$200.00} that remained in the account, taken out due to unusual activity that I immediately notified the bank to not process, instead resulted in a cascade effect in which not only is the {$200.00} gone, the account currently sits at a negative balance of {$610.00}, of which {$490.00} is solely due to XXXX and the bank attempting to collect the same {$9.00} and {$5.00} multiple times a day for multiple days, and then returning the payment and charging me, despite no permissions granted to do as much.

3071,"On XXXX/XXXX/16 I received an email alert letting me know that my checking account was overdrawn. The email was puzzling since I know that I had not purchased any big ticket items. I immediately went to the bank branch where I opened my account to see what happened. This is what was explained to me : My checking account had been charged a series of 'mini fees ' that had been collected through debit card transactions. I asked why would the bank allow the transactions to continue when there was no money in the account? There was a mediocre explanation that eventually led to a requested print-out, by me, of my account. The print out revealed that SunTrust had been charging fees to my account of XXXX for each and every transaction. On some days, my account was charged up to XXXX of these XXXX fees on the same day. I 've been with SunTrust for less than six months, and they continue to, or the employee who opened the account, continues to make glaring errors in relation to my account. How? First, the account was set up improperly. Second, the representative who opened the account did not explain all of my options to me. This experience leads me to believe that there is poor management at this branch location ( XXXX XXXX ) and that the manager, XXXX XXXX is doing a horrible job with both managing and properly training his employees.  On XXXX/XXXX/16 I left a message at the branch requesting that XXXX XXXX call me. On XXXX/XXXX/16 when I saw XXXX XXXX to check on my account status, he had not even looked into it and explained to me that he had been busy. On XXXX/XXXX/16, XXXX XXXX explained to me that again he had been busy. It was not until that day that he even begin addressing my account. To this day, he has not taken responsibility in the mismanagement of my account and instead is trying to cover up for his employee, XXXX XXXX, who opened my accounts. I believe that XXXX XXXX and XXXX XXXX are more interested in meeting their account quotas instead of the care and attention to the consumer.  When I first opened account XXXX XXXX made a serious error of placing all of my money into my savings account instead of my checking account, as I had requested. This resulted in gross errors that led had to be straightened out when I went to pay my bills ; Certain payments did not go through due to XXXX XXXX 's error. In that instance, I do not believe XXXX XXXX was counseled by his manager. Something is amiss in the training if XXXX XXXX is allowed to continue making these mistakes and his manager is content with making excuses for his employees instead of re-training his employees and making sure the consumer is okay. XXXX XXXX sent me an email claiming that he tried to call me on the XXXX, but I do not believe that to be true, as I received no phone call. I, once again, had to be the one following up with him concerning my account.  A total of approximately XXXX in fees were charged to my checking account ; fees that are both exorbitant and ludicrous seeing the nature of the fees. SunTrust was allowing card transactions to go through whether or not there was any money in the account. I feel that this was an instant payday predatory practice by the bank as they are aware that my paychecks are direct deposited every two weeks like clockwork. I believe that I was seen as an easy target and money could be made from my account due to my direct deposit. I will reiterate that these options were not explained to me thoroughly when I opened my account. My account was set up improperly. It is for this reason that I am requesting a full refund of all of my fees. SunTrust has violated my trust and is exploiting the consumer.  My account was being charged for debit card transactions of XXXX, XXXX, XXXX, XXXX, XXXX, XXXX, XXXX, XXXX, XXXX, XXXX, etc. SunTrust is taking advantage of consumers.   ",mxuan@purdue.edu,1

I think there has been a presumption on their part to conclude without adequate investigation that I was the one to open the card. USAA I am told is typically open only to people either in the military or relatives of military.

Here is what I am proposing you immediately remove any and all inquiries from all XXXX credit bureaus and pay me a settlement of {$10000.00}. The offer for settlement is more than fair considering your cost in legal fees would far exceed that amount. This must be done on or before 14 calendar days from receipt of this notice. If you opt to not to do so then I will have no choice but to seek the full amount entitled to under FCRA plus actual damages. Please confirm receipt of this notice by calling XXXX.

3266,"In XXXX 2015 I opened a secured credit card account with Capital One Bank via an initial opening security deposit of {$300.00}. It took approximately 14 days for the processing of that initial deposit to occur. Since that time I have made XXXX consecutive payments, all made from the same account as the initial funding deposit. On XXXX/XXXX/15 I attempted to make a new deposit to the account, but due to a banking error on the payment end by XXXX, the funding account bank, it was rejected. After identifying the issue with XXXX, I had the error corrected and resubmitted another deposit of the same {$100.00} to Capital One for credit to my credit line. After receiving, and processing ( ie  cashing '' ) the deposit, Capital One placed a  fraud alert '' on my credit account, and froze all funds in the account. They cited as explanation the returned item from XXXX as  suspected fraud '' and have since been holding all funds while they draw interest on the money and I am left without access to any of it. The problem is that 1 ) no fraud existed as I clearly own the XXXX account 2 ) the same XXXX account has been repeatedly used to fund and make all payments on this account 3 ) my banking relationship with XXXX Bank is of absolutely no business of Capital One and the demands that they are making to information regarding that account are far outside of the scope legally required or necessary.

After receiving the check the individual that the check was written out to was unsuccessful in cashing it and the check bounced, after which that individual acquired {$12.00} in fees. After it was brought to my attention, I was perplexed as to why the check would bounce, since I specifically inquired about my balance that same week while I was depositing my funds. After investigating the issue and spending a substantial amount of my time at the bank, I was informed that the reason why my check bounced was  inconsistencies with my signature. '' Although, I appreciate the efforts of Wells Fargo to protect their clients from fraudulent activities, I am extremely upset that Wells Fargo would not make any attempts to contact me before canceling my OWN check and causing me so much stress and time on resolving this issue. I did not receive any notification or messages informing me of the issue and the check was simply canceled and I almost ended up losing extremely valuable transaction and prior deposits that were associated with that transaction! I was also informed that I may be charged additional fees ( {$35.00} XXXX in regards to this transaction. I am perplexed on how I ca n't assign my own funds and Wells Fargo can simply just cancel a transaction because  it seemed like it was n't my signature '' and for Wells Fargo not make a reasonable attempt in contacting me. The account was opened 10 years ago and there might be minor changes in signatures for different reasons like older age. I 'm just wondering why Wells Fargo did n't bounce all of my other checks that were substantially smaller in their amount value, since I write out a lot of them every month. My signatures vary and are not identical every time. It seems that it only benefits Wells Fargo. I had to repay the {$12.00} to the individual for acquiring the fees, additionally had to pay {$10.00} for the cashiers check because I could n't use my OWN check. I do n't see the purpuse of having checks if i ca n't use them. Also, I was informed that for the issue to be resolved I had to write a letter explaining the situation, which I did. It was still not good enough and I was continuously transferred from one department to the next. Wells Fargo representative informed me that they would reimburse me, but they could n't since the receiving party was not a Wells Fargo customer. Does n't make sense to me! They are essentially admitting their fault but ca n't resolve the issue. Every time I will have to write a check for a large amount, I have to notify them?!? It is so frustrating to feel like you have done everything right on your part and you still ca n't get a resolution.  I would like for the issue to be resolved and all of the fees associated with this transaction reimbursed or stopped, since I do n't feel that I should be held accountable for Wells Fargo 's inadequate assumptions about my own signature. Additionally this account is a joint account and both names on the account have the same initials, hence the confusion might of emerged from there. In any case, I would like to get refunded the {$12.00} that I had to repay, in addition address any further fees/penalties on my account.   ",mxuan@purdue.edu,1

I get disconnected and had to call back. A different rep said it was true I had not received a credit and he called XXXX. XXXX did not answer so the rep said there was nothing he could do and I had to fill out another form. I was switched to a supervisor XXXX who was very lecturing and annoyed and told me nothing could be done until I filled out another claim form and told me I needed to provide a lot more information than was on their form. She said if they dropped the ball in not contacting XXXX I still had to pay because it took me too long to  notice '' due to their XXXX day policy. XXXX was only interested in getting me off the phone and not resolving the problem. The Protection service does not work. Their claim system is broken and they do n't care. The policies are for the convenience of Chase Bank and not the customer. They go through the motions of talking to customers and being courteous but leave the customer holding the bag. There is no way to tell how many customers have been overbilled due to their so called  protection benefit '' and when they call in, they are made to jump through so many hoops, they either give up or are not helped so Chase keeps their money.

3456,I went to pnc bank in XXXX XXXX To make the deposit and the gentleman who worked at the bank wanted to do me a new card with my married name on it I explain to him that I would not have my ID changed with my married name on it and I did n't want to have a card that had my married name on it and my drivers license I have my maiden name on it. He explained to me that I could continue to use the card that I had until I was ready to activate the card that had my married name on it and there would be no issues so I agreed and told him he could go to the card. Well yesterday XXXX XXXX 2015 I went to go use my card and it was declined then I try to use it at an ATM instead of a merchant place in the ATM told me to call PNC. When I called PNC they explained to me that I was using the wrong card I did not understand that they were talking about. I gave the lady on my card number with the expiration date she told me that that was the wrong expiration date on the card the number was correct. I asked her if I could speak with the supervisor because I was n't understanding what was wrong. I talked to the supervisor who explained to me that when the new card is ordered to you you have 15 days to activate your card with the old card deactivated I explained to her the situation that I explained to the gentleman at the branch I asked them if they could reactivate my card because I did not have my card that was the new one on me explain to them that I have no money on me and I was at work all day and I needed to at least get lunch if there is a way for them to activate the card so I could please get something to eat because I have a medical condition that I need to take medicine with and I needed to have food so I can take the medicine they explained to me that the card is deactivated it can not be reactivated so I explain to them that I did n't know the rule of the 15 days the gentleman at the branch never told me back and I do n't think it 's appropriate to deactivate someone 's car without their knowledge. She apologize for this situation with my work not having any money or access to any money thing to them that I was at work and I could n't leave work and they said you have to go to the branch if you need money and I did n't understand why they could not reactivate my card if they deactivated it how come I ca n't reactivate it. I explain to them I needed to have access to my money back you can not deny me access to my money and that is exactly what they did. Else explain to the gentleman here I spoke with his first name is XXXX 's last name is XXXX who was not understanding to the fact that I did not have any money and I had medical issue and unwilling to fix the mistake that he and see me persistently told me that I needed to go to the branch I explained to him that I was at work and there was no branch close enough to me that I could go to and come directly back to work and when I got off at XXXX less of the branches close. So I asked if it would be an issue if I would consider friends because my drivers license name and my married name for XXXX different names would that be an issue he said it should n't be. Then I asked if I could get a card from the branch he told me no and that was a lie because some branches can give cards and XXXX did @ XXXX. So because I had to take my medicine without food because pnc denied me access to my money I was rather ill for the remainder of the day as well as today. So all in all the lack of correct information given to me by severely employee 's of PNC not only caused me not to have access to my money but also caused me unpleasant illness. Other than being sick I did n't think anything could deny you access to your money and that 's my biggest issue with PNC at the moment but they denied me access to my money I deactivated my car without my knowledge in the act as if it 's okay to do such things.   ,li470@purdue.edu,1

They did not provide any advanced notice. This was done without any discovery of fact procedure, arbitration or legal hearing. My account did not have sufficient funds and therefore was overdrawn. A check for local property tax was outstanding and subject to penalties. The entry that triggered this action was a direct deposit from the IRS on XXXX XXXX, 2015, a month and a half earlier. I have not received any correspondence from the IRS about any issues. I understand the clearing of funds between banks and the need to reverse transactions.

I believe all issues are with Chase Bank and their handling of the transaction and their procedures for confiscating money. I have contacted Chase and they are working to resolve the error. I hope and expect the monetary portion to be resolved. What can not be resolved is the procedural issue which allows a bank to at their whim without notification and any formal procedure to confiscate money from an account holder.

She told me that the company would send a list of different stores they would want me to check out and send a check for me to cash to have funds to shop to assist in being  mysterious ''. My friend had been working as a mystery shopper as a side job alongside her daily full-time job. She was even cashing her checks at the local XXXX in which she never got into any trouble for doing so neither was red flagged about it. So I truly believed that the mystery shopper job was legit, especially if XXXX cashed their checks.

They could not tell me the person 's name whom I spoke with the day prior, they could not even tell me my balance, let alone what was happening with my account, because they had zero access!!! On the XXXX, Bank of America could not help me.  This is the second time in XXXX weeks my card information had been compromised.  I do not allow other persons to use my card, and I am very concerned about the security policies here at this bank, plus - the customer service for its business banking customers. Being overdrawn almost {$900.00} and not being able to speak to anyone about it is extremely disconcerting, and I will be pulling my money from this bank and closing my accounts immediately. I am outraged at the service I received.  The banking associate at my local branch issued me a temp card - which began with the same XXXX digits as my last replacement - and had the same expiration year. Why would a bank issue cards with matching numbers? Is n't this making it easier for fraud?  Why was I asked to fill out paperwork regarding charges that were clearly not mine?  Why was I alerted by my bank about the charges - but charges were made thereafter?  Why could I not speak to anyone regarding my account, on a holiday? So what? There are n't XXXX people in the world that are working today on behalf of their business consumers?  As a new business, a situation like this could be crippling. I have thousands of dollars that I need to deposit to continue functioning as a business - but I can not trust my bank and I am forced to switch banks, which will not be an easy change, I can only assume.

I am retired and receive a monthly Social Security check and a pension check from my former employer. My wife continues to work and will receive her XXXX Social Security check next month. In checking my bank statement today, I discovered that I had been charged five overdraft fees of {$35.00} each.  My account never had a negative balance. My wife and I went to the bank on this past Saturday to deposit a payroll check from her company. I specifically told the Teller in front of my wife that I was depositing a pay check and asked her to deposit the amount of the check as cash as the bank had agreed to do many times before. The Teller advised me and my wife that the check was deposited as cash. Today, I discovered that the bank had deposited {$500.00} as cash and the remainder of the check as a check subject to the banks holding policy on checks deposited into checking accounts. I called the Customer service XXXX number and explained the problem. The service representative understood my complaint and put me on hold to talk to her Supervisor. When she returned to the call, she advised that she was transferring me to her Manager to resolve the problem. Her Supervisor immediately got the Branch Manager of the XXXX Bank on the line and left the call. I explained the problem to the Branch Manager and she asked me if I had identified the check as a payroll check. I told her that I had done this as I have done many times previously. She said that the Teller was working today and put me on hold to ask her if I had identified the check in question as a payroll check. She got back on the line and said that the Teller did n't recall but later called me back and said that the Teller did remember cashing my check as cash, giving me {$500.00} at the time and depositing the remaining {$1600.00} as cash into our checking account. However, our account did n't reflect this understanding causing the {$170.00} overdraft fee. The Branch Manager said she would look into this but called me back to advise that she could n't reverse the {$170.00} overdraft fees because there has been a change in policy resulting in our account being charged the fees. I told her that we were not advised of any change in policy and the Teller had told us that the check was being deposited as cash into our checking account. Our checking account still remains debited for {$170.00}. I believe that TD Bank is fully aware of my problem and similar problems but has failed to change their accounting rules and processes because these mistakes benefit the Bank at their customers expense XXXX. I am asking the CFPB to help me resolve my specific problem by having the bank return the {$170.00} in fees to me and to look at the broader consequences for consumers if this TD Bank policy is allowed to continue.

On XXXX XXXX, {$160.00} was deducted from my PayPal account without warning or explanation. In  Non-receipt - Claim - # XXXX '', the buyer was awarded a full refund for his claim that Transaction # XXXX was not completed due to the item in question not being received. Upon learning of this issue, I promptly replied by responded to both PayPal and the buyer directly through eBay 's messaging service. I also provide physical proof of the product 's shipment via USPS and the Customs Barcode Number XXXX.   The buyer himself had the option to alert me as the shipper that he had not received the item within a reasonable time frame before elevating his concerns to a PayPal claim. That is not a constructive or courteous way to do business particularly with sellers in the eBay marketplace in good standing with as high a rating as I have. Further to that, I negotiated a resolution to the problem directly with the buyer that was satisfactory to him albeit still a financial loss to me. I uploaded the text of that offer to the PayPal claim folder and discussed it over the phone with a PayPal customer service rep who approved of it and welcomed my cooperation.   My offer was to replace the item rather than reimburse the buyer because the rarity of the time made replacement a more attractive and valuable option to him. In response, the buyer agreed to  give up XXXX his ) claim ''. I followed by explaining that it would take me a couple of days before sending the poster in question because I was low on funds in my PayPal account. On XXXX XXXX he accepted my offer and agreed with my evaluation of the mishap. However, having not honored his own offer to cancel the claim, before I could ship the replacement item either he, PayPal or XXXX deducted the full amount from my PayPal account which not only disallowed me the ability to purchase shipping, but prevented my ability to ship to any of my eBay customers as it put my account in a negative balance.   As these emails document, the buyer understood and agreed on XXXX XXXX that it would take me  a couple of days '' to send the item. However, not did he not fulfill his obligation to cancel the claim, in those two days after the claim was decided in his favor and my money was gone. Not only is that an egregious and callous act on the part of both the buyer and PayPal, but there is no shipping service that would have been able to deliver the package according to our agreement before the case was decided.   I was only informed by PayPal with a pair of automatically generated emails that offered me no ability, much less professional courtesy, to respond. When I spoke to PayPal 's customer service, I was met only with didactic, patronizing rhetoric and no constructive explanation or remedy.   I do n't need to remind you of what is now public knowledge and that which is increasingly deteriorating your companies credibility and reputation.

I have changed accounts four times for security reasons, but I never left my bank. It has been about ten months or so since that the overdraft fees that bank of America charges have become outrageous. Bank of America reorders debit card transactions/e-bill payments and withdraws in various ways ( usually placing the higher amounts first that will leave customers with negative balances XXXX, therefore ; the average client will be left with more than a few costly overdraft fees. Every time I have called to complain about how my available balance changes from day to day, the supervisors and customer representatives tell me that the automatic system rearrange transactions in different ways. Sometimes the automatic system will process larger transactions first and others the system will not process transactions correctly over the weekend. Consequently, on Monday morning the average costumer will be surprised with a bunch of overdraft fees. I have asked supervisors and customer reps to amend the mistakes that the automatic service makes. Some managers will waive a few charges. Others, like the last supervisor I spoke with will tell me that if I balance my account using my phone or a computer, I am destined to pay overdraft fees every week. If that is the truth, why does bank of America promotes mobile applications, online banking usage and online statements? Then, to make it more ridiculous the supervisor told me that if I kept doing my balance using paper and pencil and comparing it with my online balance, I was also destined to be charged hundreds of dollars in overdraft fees. Supervisors keep talking about the automatic service and blaming it for all overdraft fees like the automatic service is an electronic device that ca n't be handled by human beings ( it has its own mind ). My sister who was a loyal customer for XXXX years of Bank of America left the bank because of the same reason : Bank of America is rearranging deposits and withdraws anyway they want, so they can make millions charging overdraft fees. Something has to be done to stop Bank of America for charging overdraft fees in order to increase costs to average consumers for their benefit.   ",dai77@purdue.edu,1

As proof, Chase provided me photocopies of the XXXX fraudulent checks endorsed with a forged signature ( see Ex. 3 ).  Prior to this incident, I had been a loyal Chase customer. Despite this, Chase did not follow the requirements of EFTA in investigating my fraud claim. I believe that Chase may have treated me this way because I am a person XXXX and/or a low income customer.  Section 909 ( b ) of EFTA states that the burden of proof is on the financial institution to show that the alleged fraudulent transaction was authorized. The OCC Comptroller 's Handbook on EFTA ( XXXX 2014 ) states  institutions can not assume that they have satisfied their duty to investigate simply by concluding that the customer 's debit card and PIN were used ... .rather, institutions must take steps to investigate whether there are indications that unauthorized use occurred. '' According to EFTA staff commentary ( Supp. I, 12 C.F.R. 205.11 ( c ) ( 4 ) -5 ), information that may be reviewed includes : - The transaction history of the particular account for a reasonable period of time immediately preceding the allegation of error. Previous authorized withdrawals from my account show a pattern of small-dollar ATM withdrawals of less than {$200.00} made once every few days or weeks. There is no pattern of same-day withdrawals of large sums of money ( more than {$1000.00} ).

XXXX fraudulent checks were deposited and XXXX unauthorized ATM withdrawals were made at XXXX separate Chase branches ( see Ex. 1 ). Review of the security camera footage would show the transactions were not made by me.  A review of these items as part of an investigation under EFTA should have shown to Chase that the deposits and withdrawals on XX/XX/XXXX and XX/XX/XXXX respectively were fraudulent and unauthorized.

When I went to my local Chase branch, the banker I was working with actually admitted that it was negligent for them to have not put any fraud warning on my accounts when I told them that my wallet had been stolen. He also said it was very unusual for someone to actually walk into a bank and impersonate someone else and withdraw money. He helped me file claims and told me it would take 10 business days for me to be refunded. The Chase banker told me that Chase will do their own investigation to figure out how and why this teller allowed someone who was n't me to withdraw my money but also told me that I was n't allowed to know anything about the investigation - I would not be told any results. He told me they 'd have to  investigate '' to make sure that I was n't scamming them - pretending that my money was gone when in fact I had withdrawn it myself. I filed police reports and everything as well. Well, it has now been 13 business days and I have not been refunded.

And guess what? The person who stole my wallet has all of that information and could have easily pretended to be me. Chase needs to implement some better security procedures, such as asking a security question when you go to withdraw large amounts of money, and actually implementing the security questions when they say they will.

Early this year I began receiving notices against each of my accounts from Chase Bank, other than the home mortgage, that Chase has decided to close all of my personal and XXXX Credit Card accounts. I was given a certain date to close my accounts out. Chase said it was within its rights to do so and they did n't have to give me a reason for their action. Including in those accounts were XXXX custodial accounts ; XXXX accounts belong to my daughters attending XXXX XXXX and XXXX of my XXXX-years old mother. I found it outrageous but decided to comply with their requests.   I rushed to open new bank accounts with another institution and got new credit cards from XXXX and XXXX XXXX. I went to the local branch of Chase Bank and settled all of my credit cards and withdrew my personal funds.   My Mileage Plus United Chase Visa card, XXXX of XXXX credit cards with Chase, had {$10000.00} balance due per the previous months statement that I paid it off on XXXX XXXX, 2015. On XXXX XXXX, 2015, I went to the local bank branch and paid the {$990.00}, the balance incurred since the last statement. Later, I learned that bank assessed additional {$87.00} interest on XXXX XXXX, 2015 that also was paid on XXXX XXXX, 2015, via a phone call. I was entitled to a refund on the annual fee of {$85.00} assessed earlier.   I had used online access, portal provided by the Chase Bank, to manage my accounts. After the accounts were settled and closed Chase took away my on-line access. In XXXX 2015, I was denied a refinancing loan on my personal residence because Chase had reported {$370.00} due on my XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX account and reported XXXX late payments ranging between {$25.00} and {$42.00} over the next three month. That was the first time I learned I had derogatory reports on my credit report.   I called the Bank on XXXX XXXX to confirm these charges. I did not realize that after I had paid up my last balance and brought my XXXX XXXX balance to XXXX on XXXX XXXX, Chase allowed XXXX unauthorized charges that I had no knowledge of on the XXXX Card on XXXX XXXX and XXXX for {$290.00}. Chase also refunded {$85.00} annual fee and had an outstanding balance of {$200.00}. ( XXXX  XXXX bank statements are attached. ) Over the next 6 months that balance became {$370.00} after Chase added late fee and interest and reported XXXX late payments to the Credit Bureaus. Chase never attempted to contact me via a phone call or sent a customary letter or provided monthly bank statements.   Chase customer service representative, who identified herself as XXXX, told me that it was not Bank 's responsibility to inform me about my statements because I was using an on-line access. The fact that the on-line access was taken away after I was forced to close my accounts was none of their concern. However, the Bank felt obliged to continue to assess interest and penalties and also reported to the Credit Bureaus but saw no reason to inform me. I requested the bank statements.   After the bank statements were received I called bank on XXXX XXXX, 2015, to resolve my credit report issues.

But, the market value of my money is the same as of those they called as  new money ''. This  new money '' is often the result of closing an account and re-opening it again.  The first answer of my bank was they were unable to locate my account. Then, they said, that there were too many XXXX XXXX and they did not know who I am.  Today, after 3 months dealing with them and waiting for a solution ... they offered me 3 months rate at XXXX and afterwards 0.6 %.  I do not need the intervention of too many people or reps and 3 months waiting period for closing my account, sit in the lobby for XXXX min, and re-open my account again with  new money ''.

I would like to obtain your help if possible in handling this complaint. They are excusing behind an argument that customers has to be checking for  bank offers '', but instead, they do change  offers '' at its convenience b/c my XXXX account was openned at an interest rate of ( at least XXXX XXXX or higher.

3937,"On XXXX XXXX, 2015 I noticed an unauthorized charge on my small business checking account at Wells Fargo that had occurred on XXXX/XXXX/2015. The charge read  XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX '' and was for {$200.00}. I tried to notify Wells Fargo online about the charge, but the form on the site indicated I had to call. I did call, and the representative assured me they would look into the charge. No change was made on the account and the charge still remained. No messages from Wells Fargo were posted to the account message center and no other communication was sent to me via email or letter.  On XXXX/XXXX/2015 I called Wells Fargo to ask for the status. After being cut off three times navigating the bank 's phone system, I spoke to a representative who told me the charge would remain because I had not disputed it within 24 hours. I said I had disputed it within 24 hours of noticing the charge, but she insisted I only had 24 hours from the time the charge was posted to the account. When I asked why they had not notified me, she said a letter had recently been sent. I also spoke with her supervisor who gave me the same response ; although both indicated they were sorry. I asked why the person who took my original call had indicated the charge would be corrected if found to be incorrect, and I was told that person had  been mistaken. '' I asked to speak with the supervisor 's supervisor and was told I would receive a call back. I did not receive that call. This process took more than an hour.  Some important points : 1 ) I informed Wells Fargo within minutes after I became aware of the charge. 2 ) This is a business account where I have money, but I often go some time without making a withdrawal. 3 ) I was sent a debit card for this account but I 'm quite sure I never intentionally activated it and I know for sure I have never used it ( the card was shredded shortly after receiving it ). No credit card or line of credit is associated with this account. 4 ) The charge I disputed is the only charge on that account for XX/XX/XXXX ( there were also no charges in XX/XX/XXXX ). I have since moved most money from that account out of concern that fraudulent activity might resume. XXXX ) I do n't know the source of the charge. Wells Fargo has not told me if they consider the charge to be a debit-card charge, a credit-card charge, or some other type of transfer ( the first XXXX should not be possible ). I presume it 's not a check since no image is posted online. 6 ) Lacking information from Wells Fargo, I do n't know how to contact the source of the charge -- I ca n't find them online from the information provided -- and I do n't know whether this is simply a mistake or fraudulent activity. 7 ) Wells Fargo indicated that they made no attempt to ascertain whether or not the charge was fraudulent or an error. Their investigation was limited to whether or not I had noticed the charge in time. 8 ) The idea that I have to monitor my account every day and notify the bank of any unauthorized activity within 24 hours is outrageous, especially on an account that has not had authorized transactions for XX/XX/XXXX and XX/XX/XXXX ( with the exception of a deposit and transfers made because of this potentially fraudulent activity ). 9 ) I checked the account on XX/XX/XXXX to see if a deposit made on XX/XX/XXXX had been posted. Even though I 've been making deposits for more than 20 years from the same highly reputable source, Wells Fargo often arbitrarily puts holds on deposits. So I do check those. 10 ) I notified Wells Fargo of the unauthorized charged before receiving a statement for the month. I do review the statement monthly and it 's my expectation that is the time to look for concerns with Wells Fargo 's management of the account and that any clock that starts on notification should start with the statement or a communication from Wells Fargo.

This obviously pulls my credit score down. Another thing I reiterate is the fact that I have a Coastal HELOC in place ( with a high balance ), that is dropping my score as well.

I then asked that since Capital One policy states that statements ca n't be corrected, would n't I be stuck with a Bank statement that showed incorrect information for that hypothetical check transaction where check XXXX showed as check XXXX.

4014,"To whom this may concern, I am writing to the CFPB in attempts to resolve an ongoing dispute between myself and Scottrade Bank. Briefly, my Scottrade Bank was hacked because of poor security and data handling policies and Scottrade Bank has refused to honor their Online Security Guarantee listed here : XXXXI am specifically writing in to better understand Scottrade Bank 's policies on examining fraud that may have been a result of a combined phishing and remote access tool (  RAT '' ) hack.   For background, at the time of the hack my laptops were security with antivirus and personal information was never shared. I always took security precautions to keep my personal information safe. However, Scottrade Bank did not give me the same courtesy and at one point instructed me to send personal information over an insecure email server.   Upon information and belief, and months of forensic analysis it have been determined that the likely method of the hack was the marriage of a remote access tool ( delivered via socially engineered email ) and leaked personal information that could be easily bought and sold on internet. Indeed, examining various emails in my inbox showed that a number of phishing attempts were made and although anti-virus was installed it is very easy to  crypt '' or  encode '' a virus to be fully undetectable. Indeed, at the time of the hacking most anti-virus software was unable to detect a very common and maliciously used version of XXXX RAT which as the FBI had previously announced has been used in numerous financial account hacks. It is clear that the use of a RAT in combination with the information Scottrade Bank leaked insecure emails and or left insecure via database vulnerabilities resulted in the hacking or at least contributed to the hacking of my Scottrade Bank account.   It is worth noting that Scottrade Bank did not flag any of the enormously unusual transactions accumulating to over {$800000.00} and suspicious even though they were unequivocally out of the accounts normal behavioral patters and not within the limits of the customer consider the Know-Your-Customer information, such as salary, debt, and profession submitted to Scottrade Bank.   I am writing to Scottrade Bank to better understand how Scottrade Bank defends against ubiquitous RAT viruses commonly used in financial account takeovers. In the instance I described above, Scottrade Bank even refused to analyze my computer despite there being signs of virus activity. Furthermore, Scottrade Bank internally and externally recognizes the existence of RATs and has been warned of the potential of illicit account takeovers via RATs through various financial regulatory briefings and financial cooperation events.   Presumably, given the fair and ample warning Scottrade Bank received about RATs I am curious as to why Scottrade Bank still relies on a  Multi-Factor '' and not  out of band '' authentication techniques that have no way of distinguishing or fail to distinguish between legitimate customer behavior and fraudulent account takeovers.   In this case Scottrade Bank relies on information given from a XXXX security tool known as  XXXX Multi Factor Authentication '', this tool provides no ability to distinguish between a RAT and a legitimate customer because it only logs computer information and relies on insecure plain-text  secondary questions '' which are by default remembered within the browser history of a computer, such that a computer infected with a RAT gives a hacker all of the information needed to infiltrate an online account. As a result this is a failed layer of security and it gets worse.   Scottrade has no  behavioral '' red flags that indicate whether a transaction might be suspicious or not. For example, in the instance above, the account was hacked and multiple {$200000.00} ACH transfer were initiated ...   ",cthieme@purdue.edu,0

I spoke to a representative who stated that they do not provide invoice numbers for toll transactions. I asked if we could contact the Turnpike Authority together via conference call, she stated she can not call outside companies. I said I would initiate the call, she refused. She gave no option to dispute the charges stating that XXXX has  probably already paid the charge and therefore the Administrative fee is accurate ''.

4062,"This is my fourth complaint about overdraft fees on my account. I am attaching documentation to show that Key Bank changes the order of credits and debits to accounts. I would appreciate someone from the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau to closely look at my documentation this time as I have copied my account over the last two days to show the discrepancies in accounting. This last overdraft I received because I moved XXXX $ from my standard checking to my son 's Hassle Free account. The reason my account over drew in the first place two days ago was because of the fees debited by Key Bank. On the ledger there is no sign of overdraft before the fees were debited. In response to the overdraft complaint yesterday, Key Bank sent a tutorial with a fictitious person named XXXX who is XXXX XXXX and very young. The tutorial says that she over drew her account buying coffee and donuts. Besides the very problematic racialization of XXXX, Key Bank blames the customer when actually what is happening is that Key Bank alters the timing of debits and credits in ways that incur overdrafts. My ledger shows several deposits in the last few days yet they mysteriously move around in the ledger as do debits. Once an overdraft is debited in accounts that are fragile ( meaning no overdraft protection attached and low balances ) these fees throw the account into disarray resulting in yet more overdraft fees. Please CFP look carefully at my account. I am not some crazy person continuing to complain. I am an educated woman who follows her account diligently and I am going to continue to complain because I know if this is happening to me, it 's happening to others who perhaps do not have the money to pay the fees. I have attached a short analysis in a document. It 's short becasue i really do not have time to do this every day. I want these fees to stop. I am probably going to receive yet another overdraft fee because my account was overdrawn this morning. The only reason my account is overdrawn is that Key Bank has debited excessive overdraft fees from my checking account..   ",ahbruns@purdue.edu,0
4063,"Check  clearing '' is the process of moving a check from the bank in which it was deposited to the bank on which it was drawn, and the movement of the money in the opposite direction. Due to Bank of America 's ( BoA ) banking malpractice - stating that a check is  cleared ( C ) '' prior to completing check verification, and BoA bank teller not informing that the check has  not cleared '' after check verification as well as transaction receipt not reflecting this - BoA was responsible for a fraudulent act to be committed on me, which will become evident by the supporting information provided. On XXXX XXXX, I had deposited a check for {$7100.00}. On XXXX XXXX, the BoA bank teller stated check  cleared '' and I withdrew {$3100.00}. On XXXX XXXX, I withdrew a Cashier 's check for {$4000.00}.

BoA rep mentioned that on XXXX XXXX midnight the check was processed and verified to be altered/fictitious, and that this information was updated to the system by XXXX XXXX on XXXX XXXX, and that the bank teller at the BoA XXXX XXXX NJ branch was able to see this information in the system. However, when I had been to the branch on XXXX XXXX at XXXX XXXX, the bank teller said that the check was  cleared ''. She did not mention the check was processed and  not cleared '', but instead that the check was  cleared ''.

Questions:1. If, as mentioned by the BoA claims rep, the check was processed on XXXX XXXX XXXX and verified to be fictitious/altered, and the information was updated to the system by XXXX XXXX on XXXX XXXX : a. Why did the online account show the check as  cleared '' ( C ) on XXXX XXXX?  b. Why did the teller not inform me that the check was verified to be fictitious/altered as of XXXX XXXX on XXXX XXXX, and thus  not cleared ''?  c. Why did the cash withdrawal transaction receipt of XXXX XXXX on XXXX XXXX show the remaining available balance after withdrawing {$3100.00} to be {$210000.00} and not {$200000.00} ( available balance before depositing check was {$200000.00} )?   XXXX. If, for the purposes of argument, the check verification was completed after XXXX XXXX on XXXX XXXX : a. Why did the online account show the check as  cleared '' ( C ) on XXXX XXXX?  b. Why did the BoA claims rep tell me that the verification was completed on XXXX XXXX XXXX, and that the information was updated to the system by XXXX XXXX on XXXX XXXX?   XXXX.

They would either send me a check or I could get XXXX to do the transfer. At no time during this conversation, did BOA mention a fee for making this transfer. Since the IRS has strict rules about taking the money from an IRA and moving it on my own, I decided to ask Ally to do the transfer. Once the transfer was complete, BOA notified me that they withheld {$50.00} from the transfer, calling it a processing fee. I contacted them and they said that they told XXXX about the fee and that XXXX should have informed me. They also said that this fee is stated on my quarterly statement. XXXX said that if BOA had told them about this fee, they would have instructed them to relay the information to me and that it was n't their responsibility to inform another bank 's customer of their fees.

Also, why are they entitled to a processing fee, when they refused to initiate the transfer and XXXX was the one who did all of the work? I spoke to several customer service people at BOA after this occurred and they maintain that they have a right to charge this fee. They may have this right, but is it fair, especially considering how small of an account this was.

4152,I 've had a problem with Capital One Bank for months now. My account information was stolen and there were several out of state purchases made with both mine and my husband 's debit cards. Capital One refused to investigate and return us the money although they do advertise a risk free debit card. They basically blamed us for everything and did nothing even after we proved that we were not at the place where the charges were made. Their customer service is the worse and we are beginning to suspect it might have been their own employees stealing our account information. We have worked with other banks and are currently using a different one but never encountered this problem.   ,zhan2016@purdue.edu,0

'' It seems that the consumer IS being charged for pending transactions. Technically those funds should still be available for use for other transactions since the merchant has not sent it through for payment and IF when those pending items come to post in the future they THEN should be assessed fees should funds be unavailable.I was told it was assessed to a {$10.00} transfer to my other TD Bank account I share with my son.

4165,"My savings account was involuntarily closed after the financial institution claimed that my overdraft protection exceeded the XXXX per month - preapproved transfers for a period of 12 months. In order to avoid any returned checks or transactions, I was prohibited from making any transfers of my own. This allegation that I exceed the XXXX transaction per month is the furthest from the truth and has caused me financial hardships of authorized e-checks being returned, my account being charge overdraft fees, and thus my checking account going into the negative. The intent of the overdraft protection is to avoid overdraft fees in the amount of {$36.00}, by having any debits that exceed the checking account balance to be extracted from the savings account. I was unaware of any limits per month - not to mention, I have not exceeded the checking account balance more than XXXX times out of a 12 month period.

4166,"I have XXXX x J.P. Morgan Chase bank accounts.   J.P. Morgan Chase offers an 'alert service ' to their customers to reduce fraud, and in particular, to ensure that - should an account not have sufficient funds available - a customer is instantly 'alerted ' so as to be able to transfer or add funds to their account/s in time for a payment to be processed successfully.   This 'alert ' service is widely advertised as a part of the benefits of being a Chase banking or credit card customer.   Note that this alert service does require some 'setting up ', which I have done, and used successfully prior to this incident.   From XXXX XXXX 2015, the Chase alert service stopped working completely on all my accounts and Chase credit cards, and I have incurred substantial fees as a result of not receiving notifications of insufficient funds that would otherwise allow me to transfer or add funds in time to avoid such fees. Prior to this, I have used this service ritually with few issues, but on XXXX XXXX/XXXX/15, it began to fail completely, and Chase began to charge me ISF fees as a result.   Once I realised the issue, I contacted Chase Customer Service, and they insisted that their system was 'working fine ', and that I should set up alerts via 'Push ', Text and email just to be certain. I followed their advice and did so, ( receiving no less than XXXX emails confirming these changes to my alerts. However, despite setting up all alerts via all means, none of them worked at all. Meanwhile, Chase continued to charge me ISF fees, ignored my concerns raised, told me the alerts were just a 'free service ' to me, and were unwilling to assist any further.   After several calls, emails and texts about the issue to my Chase account manager - XXXX XXXX - he finally requested I come in to demonstrate the issue to him on XXXX/XXXX/15. While in his presence, he checked my alert settings, and then had me perform XXXX x transactions. The Chase alert system failed completely for both, so he agreed it was an issue and pledged to report it to 'National ' customer service for a full refund of the fees.   To date, none of the fees have been refunded to the account that was used for demonstrating the issue, and as a result, my account/s remain in negative balance. Chase calls and writes constantly to add funds so as to bring my account/s back into credit, but I refuse to do so, as adding funds would serve only to pay Chase their ISF fees, and I am certain any request for refund would be denied.   I do not work as hard as I do just to pay bank fees, especially when a failure on the banks part is the cause of such fees being incurred.   ",mxuan@purdue.edu,1

This seemed fishy XXXX, so I called HSBC directly since their website does not allow me to log in unless I have an active account, which to my knowledge I do not. The phone system HSBC employs will also not allow callers to speak with a representative unless they either have an active account or lie about the nature of their call.

After explaining the situation to this operator, they told me this was a fraudulent text, but could otherwise not assist me to make sure that there was no other fraud happening in connection to my identity or former account information.   While I completely understand HSBC has no controls over scammers using their name in their attempts to commit fraud, the fact that HSBC makes it not only difficult but nigh-on impossible to speak with a live human being goes beyond the pale, especially since they are active targets of fraud attempts.

4256,"I deposited a check into my Wells Fargo checking account on Friday XX/XX/2015. The account had about {$350.00} and the amount I deposited in was about {$750.00}. I woke up on Wednesday morning the XX/XX/XXXX to an email notification from the bank that the deposit was put on hold. I went down to the Wells Fargo branch that I deposited the check out to clear the hold. The branch manager notified me that the hold was placed on XX/XX/XXXX and that the reason for the hold was that during the year I had a few overdraft charges. She also told me that the decision to hold the deposit was decided upon at their home office. Where ever that is. My complaint with Wells Fargo concerning this manner is XXXX fold. First off, they know its the holiday season and that people are spending money on gifts. By withholding deposits and not immediately notifying the consumer they allow the consumer to unknowingly overdraw their accounts. The decision to withhold the deposit days after the check was processed by the bank is highly suspicious. By the XXXX of the month the check should have been well cleared. Because I had overdrawn the account before I seemed like a easy victim for them to pull their scam on. When I approached the bank manager about this issue, within a minute she was able to release the hold on the deposit from her computer without any protest. If the bank had any real concerns about this as a long term issue then why would me telling them to release the hold be enough for them to release the hold. I also find the reasoning for the hold to be dubious in the extreme. To state the reason for the hold was because of overdrafts, then not allow a deposit into the account would seem counter-intuitive. Unless of course the bank wants the clients to have more overdrafts, which it does because it then slaps a {$20.00} charge on each overdraft. Wells Fargo 's actions in this situation are deplorable and should be held with utter contempt. It seems rather clear from my perspective that Wells Fargo was looking for an opportunity to slap additional charges on me by unlawfully controlling the timing in which deposits are allowed into the account.

I did n't know this at the time, that the product I was given was not the product I asked for.

4329,"Dear XXXX, I am writing to express my concerns about a behavior of Scottrade Bank and their affiliates which may have adversely exposed my personal information and lead to identity theft and fraud.   Specifically, in going through my records in order to better understand how I could resolve ongoing identity theft, I discovered that when applying for a bank account at Scottrade Bank, Scottrade Bank improperly handled a number of documents which had very personal information on them. The actions of Scottrade Bank not only broke from the current standards of data security but also broke Scottrade Bank 's internal policies regarding handling customer information.   Specifically, on or around XXXX XXXX, 2013 XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX XXXX, a regional manager from Scottrade Bank offered to receive Scottrade Bank account application documents via email. Email is a notoriously insecure medium of communication yet XXXX XXXX allowed and offered to receive the documents via email, despite the fact that it was against Scottrade Bank 's internal policies and does not have any of the normal safeguards in place to handle personal customer information. The XXXX XXXX, 2013 email contained PDF attachments that included my full name, signature, address, bank account numbers, Social Security Number, and other very personal and sensitive information.   As is clear by Scottrade 's online disclosures and policies, Scottrade Bank states that it will never transmit customer information over email and or ask for or receive personal information via email, however, XXXX XXXX, a manager at Scottrade encouraged me to send the information by email to expedite the process, with no disclose of the security concerns.   I am writing today to ask Scottrade to explain why they let my personal information be transmitted in a way that puts me at significant risk to identity theft. I would also like to know what the current status of the email and personal information is, has it been deleted, has it been accessed, are emails records secure, who could have gained access, was the email accessed XXXX, was it confirmed a secure connection?

4344,"My wife has just gotten her SSN and found a job at XXXX. In order to get her payments, we wanted to open a new checking account. I searched if there was any bonuses for new account customers. I found First Tennessee Bank, which gives {$250.00} bonus for their online applicants. I filled out an application for her, at the end of the process the system told me that her identification is not verified and we need to go to a branch so as to further the application.  We went to the nearest branch of First Tennessee Bank and told them ( a customer representative ) the situation. She told us that she can not further that application on branch, it should be done by online. She offered us some other options, one of them was offering {$150.00} for new checking account customers who meet their criteria. Even though I accepted her offer, I still wanted to ask her why the application which I started online can not be progressed? If the branch can not further it, why did the e-mail told us to continue on the application with a branch? Then, the representative slightly agreed with me and called the phone number provided in the e-mail that First Tennessee Bank sent us during the online application process. The other representative on the call told the representative on the branch that they can not verify my wife 's identity, in other words her SSN is not valid! After the call, the branch representative suggested us to go to Social Security Office and ask them if there is anything wrong with my wife 's information. I wanted her to open the account by herself on branch. She told me that it is not possible to open a checking account once it is declined by the online banking system, even though she was saying that she can open an account ( she already knew that our online application was declined ) in the branch before that call! So, she basically did not want to open that account. Probably, she thought that opening an account for my wife is risky!  I went to Social Security Office with my wife and spent our 1 hour over there in order to ask them what is wrong with my wife 's SSN. The social security officer told us that there is nothing wrong. All of my wife 's information matches with their system. He added that First Tennessee Bank maybe did not want to open an account for us/my wife and sent us to the office so as to throw overboard, which was very logical idea for me.  After leaving the office, I called the First Tennessee Bank Online Account Service and told them the situation. They did not even want to listen to me and repeatedly told me that they are sorry and they can not help me with the situation.  After all these conversations were made and we lost our whole day by trying to deal with these narrow-minded and under-educated people, we came home and I started to search for the reasons why I had this problem. I found the core problem on another bank 's website, which is saying that if you have just gotten your SSN and do not have any background, please go to our branches. After reading this warning, I understood that she needed to have credit history in order to open an Online Checking Account. However, any of the representatives have not told us anything about this. If the case is a credit history for a checking account, which does not damage the bank, but benefits, why do n't they even help us in the branch? This is a customer disappointment. Having this bad experience with First Tennessee bank and being a person who worked at a bank for two years, I am calling this situation disgraceful for First Tennessee Bank. I have felt like we are 3rd ( or even worse ) class of people in this country, who are not wanted in here! For this reason, I wanted to tell my complaint will all the details. Tomorrow, I will go to another branch of First Tennessee Bank and try to open an account for my wife again just to see what they are going to do. I just want my rights!   ",wu467@purdue.edu,1

The {$7.00} is a monthly service fee that comes out of the account systematically on the XXXX of every month. The {$7.00} was a charge to XXXX XXXX, which was breakfast purchase XXXX/XXXX/2015. According to the ledger balance before checking my balance there was a positive balance of {$18.00} on XXXX/XXXX/2015. This figure was double checked by adding back the pending transactions in case there was something not seen on the computer ledger. According to my personal records, the balance was accurate. The same evening of XXXX/XXXX/2015 at XXXX XXXX, I charged {$31.00}, which clearly put the account in over draft. The {$31.00} cleared the bank and {$200.00} deposit posted to the account XXXX/XXXX/2015. On Monday, XXXX XXXX, 2015, we received a letter stating that our account was overdrawn the pending charge left {$2.00}, which was not enough to over the prior XXXX pending charges of {$15.00} ( {$7.00} and {$7.00} ) ; we were being charged {$50.00}.

The solidifying fact and according to Comerica 's own philosophy,  charges is not an actual charges until the charge posts to the account, which in this case there was enough money available on both XXXX/XXXX/2015 and XXXX/XXXX/2015 to cover the charges respectively. If they are to charge by the authorization date ( pending date ), there should have only been XXXX overdraft charge.

The woman there said that because I wrote the checks in question, that was not fraud on the Bank and that I would have to go to the police to get my money back.

Despite there being XXXX totally consistent beneficiary designations with the predecessor banks being located- XXXX located by Bank of America in its own internal files, Bank of America refuses to honor them -- saying that they will only honor a beneficiary designation directly with them. In addition to the XXXX beneficiary designation forms, I have notes by my mother consistently reasserting that I am the sole beneficiary.  Also Bank of America has consistently intentional or just negligently given me misleading and false information. The second beneficiary designation was located by them only after they had repeatedly represented that there was No such record. They have also incorrectly ( intentionally or negligently ) represented that there is no detriment since they are willing to pay the IRA to the Estate. The Bank should be aware of the detrimental tax consequence of the payment to an Estate rather than a person beneficiary -- even if ignorant they should at least not make false statements on which their depositors may rely to their detriment. My mother was not a wealthy woman ; she carefully saved her money and meticulously set up her accounts in accordance with her wishes. Yet now, the Bank is looking to VIOLATE her wishes and her accounts!

4525,"I have filed a dispute with for us bank with the CFPB already case # XXXX the reason I am filing another is because US Bank chose to respond to the fact that it was outside their allowed timeframe to dispute. they sent me a response to that effect to the first dispute. That however is not the reason I am filing a complaint here my issue was that us bank allowed me to open up a brand new fraud case with a brand new case # over a year later instead of telling me immediately that it was beyond the time frame to dispute. The customer service rep in the fraud dep. that I spoke to was aware of the timeframe between the account going neg and when I called them about re-opening the case. I asked if that would be a problem and was told no problem at all that they 'd just open a brand new case for me. I was not told at that time that I was beyond the time to file a case or would have moved forward with other options regarding my account to get a new reliable mode of transportation which is what I was trying to clear the account for if you read the previous complaint listed. instead I feel I was misled when they opened up a new investigation for me. I went thru all the motions and paperwork they required, I put my life on hold waiting for their response which caused additional financial hardship to me and my family. that is why there were XXXX case numbers sent with the original dispute. while waiting for them to respond my vehicle broke down costing me several hundred dollars. I would not have had the extra expense if I would have been dealt with honestly in the beginning. when I was finally given my denial months later it was for the old claim number, they did n't even refer to the new claim they started for me. I even requested a letter about the new claim number and a denial for that but never received XXXX. I believe I made that request in XXXX by phone to them. my understanding of the instructions received was that all documentation was required in a certain amount of days of the investigation being opened and receiving the fraud packet. When they opened up a new case for me I assumed I had 30 days from when I received the new fraud packet for the new case number. Does n't the fax that they opened a new case negate the old one? Do n't they have a responsibility to comply with their own rules based on the new case date?

In addition, when I explained my situation and advise the senior representative XXXX that I only have enough gas to make it to the gas station all she could tell me to do was to swipe my debit card and hope it goes through. If it does n't go through then I would be stranded at a gas station. She also told me to try to swipe it to buy food for my children and hope it goes through. If it does n't go through, I 'm left looking like a fool at the grocery store with a cart of groceries that I ca n't even pay for even though I should because the money should be available in my account. This is emotionally affecting me because I 've always been able to provide for my children and I 've always done stuff the right way. And because of Chase and their representatives for the first time and not sure if I 'm going to be able to buy food for my children because of a mistake that they made on their behalf that they ca n't correct without me doing all the leg work.

Since I had n't used my card since the day before, I was sure I had enough to cover the {$15.00} ice cream and the {$2.00} parking, which would have left my balance at {$22.00}. I did n't see this as a problem as I had a deposit that the depositing bank had emailed me about that stated it was due to post to my bank account on XX/XX/XXXX. I assumed that would occur, and either way my balance was positive. That night I paid {$15.00} toward a presidential campaign donation.

After a pause, he stated that he could no longer help me and that I needed to go to a branch. I was astonished that these were the  tough '' security questions that he asked and even more surprised that his service solution was for me to leave work and go to a branch. Clearly those questions are the very bare bones of identifying someone and I expected a deeper inquiry but received none. I asked to speak to a supervisor and XXXX stated that the supervisor would only state the same thing he did and that XXXX ( actually XXXX ) did not wish to take my call. I insisted and asked to wait to speak to a person in charge. i re-iterated that I did not wish to cause any trouble but wanted help to my issue and not deal with a branch. XXXX eventually picked up my call after the transfer and I reviewed my issue with her. She blamed the  system '' that her and XXXX use and stated their was nothing further to be done. I begged her to please ask me more difficult questions but they declined. I was open to alternatives to resolve this but XXXX and XXXX were not even remotely interested in exploring any other means. Remember, i was able to change my pin but they could n't ask me the amount of my HELOC payment. I told them that their service was poor and uncreative in spite of a basic request. I asked for her supervisor as I desired to provide sorely needed feedback and to explore further assistance if possible. I received no name, no phone number, no email to which I could address my complaint. I did receive a Client relations address to hand write a letter to. I also asked why she told XXXX that she did not wish to speak to me and or hear about my issue. She denied that that happened and in turn made XXXX a liar. Please remember this was a recored line, so there should be no dispute about any of this.   ",mcarrasc@purdue.edu,0

I then went to the branch in XXXX XXXX to notify them that the card is found and they should check on line where my information was compromised, but the banker advised me not to report!  The bank message on activation of new cards is informing clients that they will not be responsible for fraudulent charges! Should n't this apply to a loyal client of over 18 years?

Not only did I open a checking and savings, I also opened an account for my children. When my son turned XXXX years old, he was told to convert his account to adult. While away in college, my son went to XXXX, Wells Fargo to do what needs to be done ( close the kids and open an adult checking account ). Since he did n't have his social security card with him, his new account was put on a temporary status. He was given a day to bring his social security which he neglected to do. I told XXXX of the Wells Fargo representative to close his account because at that time I could n't open my safe where I out his social security card. Last month, I received an email from Wells Fargo stating a bill pay was suspended due to lack of funds. I called Wells Fargo to inquire about the email I received. When I gave my debit card number, I was asked more authentication making sure it was me. After being on the phone for over 10 minutes, the represent informed me that the debit card I gave to him was n't valid because my personal checking account is closed. I asked them who closed it, but that 's when I realized that they are supposedly closing my son 's checking account. I asked him if my son 's account is open and he informed me that his account is still open. Wells Fargo made a mistake of closing my account instead of my son. He then procee to tell asked me if I wanted to reopen my checking account. I told him  yes. '' He transferred me to another department. After giving my information for the new checking account, I was told that they could n't open it for me and that I will be getting a letter in the mail. Few days later, I received their letter with the reason why they could n't open a checking account for me. Basically, they could n't open a checking account for me because of my history and credits.  First, they made the MISTAKE of closing my account instead of my son. Second, I DO N'T recall having NSF on my checking history. Third, my mortgage with Wells Fargo is in good standing.

Once we were aware that the card had been lost and the account compromised, we filed an unauthorized electronic transaction claim with TD. At the request of bank investigator 's, a police report was filed with the XXXX XXXX Police Department.   In explicably, TD Bank has denied our claim, citing as the basis for its decision, the fact that no additional transactions were attempted after the checks deposited were returned as counterfeits and because the transactions were consistent with our normal usage pattern.

I, the account holder at Bank of America placed a stop payment on check # XXXX and check # XXXX on XXXX/XXXX/XXXX. Stop payment expired on XXXX/XXXX/XXXX.   Bank of America stated I would not need further stop payments after the expiration date due to the stale check policy : any check over 6 months old CAN NOT BE CASHED.   On XXXX/XXXX/XXXX check # XXXX was cashed at XXXX Bank.  On XXXX/XXXX/XXXX check # XXXX was cashed at XXXX Bank.  Both checks were deposited in my ex-husband 's account. Thus depleting my checking account of {$8600.00}.   Check # XXXX was almost 13 months old.  Check # XXXX was almost 8 months old.   I went to Bank of America to question how this could happen. The bank assistant manager stated this should not have happened due to  Stale Check '' cashing policies. She was trying to help me get my monies back. She stated she was recently almost fined for a XXXX (? ) Law due to a 6 month old cashed check. She requested the bank manager speak to me. He was very rude.

I then went to XXXX Bank to question their stale check cashing policy. I spoke to the bank manager. My first question was what is your stale check cashing policy? She stated 6 month old checks CAN NOT BE CASHED. I showed her a copy of my stale - stop payment checks and asked how could this happen? She very quickly stated this can happen since they were deposited and there was nothing she could do. I left very discouraged and in tears.   I then phoned the corporate office for Bank of America. I spoke with a gentlemen there who quoted the same. He was very rude. Stated clause XXXX covers the bank if any checks just happen to get cashed. It was not his problem. Again I was very discouraged as I specifically asked if the stop payment of 6 months was enough to protect my account.

5198,"Let me start by saying I have been with this bank since late XXXX 2015, and I have never had a negative balance or incurred an overdraft fee for a transaction I have made. This is the first time my account has been under, and it is entirely because of the bank. I deposited XXXX checks into my account and was waiting on a third deposit to it as well. The amounts were XXXX and XXXX. I was also expected another XXXX. I received XXXX amounts into my account the following day. One week later they debited my account XXXX without any warning! No call, no email, no letter.I called customer service and was told I would be refunded within XXXX days -- weird thing, no one could look anything about about the transaction. XXXX days passed and my account remained under XXXX. I received no correspondence either. I finally called on the XXXX day and was treated horribly by everyone I spoke with. I was transferred to at least 3 different departments and then made to feel like I had stolen their money, even though it was their error! I was told that the claim I had made had been cancelled ( again, no call, no email, nothing ). I had absolutely no idea. I have spoken to everyone from the manager of the branch in which the error occured to the Customer Service Supervisor, to the research department, to the claims department. No one could tell me what happened, nor why my money has suddenly disappeared. I viewed the transaction online once discovering the overdraft and not only is the XXXX check not even on my account information, but it shows one check only XXXX. I tried to view the details of the transaction and it said it was unable to process the request and that I would have to request to have the details mailed to me, yes it costs money. I finally spoke to corporate who told me simply, it had been an error and the money does n't exist. My question is, if the money does not exist, then why am I having to physically come up with money to put in my account to zero it out? This whole thing feels like a scam to me. I would not have even known the account was under if I had not checked ( luckily ) and then would have been incurring overdraft fees! The worst part is, I have to transfer the utilities of my household to my name before the 1st of the month and now my account is negative almost {$200.00}! I do not know what happened with the bank, but they need to get their act together. This is unacceptable, and the way I was treated afterwards was absolutely shocking. I understand errors get made ; but if this was the case then why was I not contacted and why did it take a week for them to debit the account? I have a second chance account so not only am I inconvenienced by having to go into the bank to deposit my checks and cash, but a check deposit is also held if it is over {$200.00}. This deposit was not held, leaving me to believe that the money had come from two separate sources. I would like my account closed, I do not appreciate the treatment or service I have received from this bank on any level.

The folks doing this were alleged  loan officers '' from whatever name they used. I was not happy. Called the bank first to have these transactions reversed immediately. I like to try and pay my bills. I argued at length with the phone reps telling them I was not the one who called in making these claims. I was sure they kept records of there calls, asked them to research. Finally I went to the branch I usually use. Spoke To XXXX, president, he too shook his head no when I began to explain that a third party did what they did. Got more frustrated. Mentioned I 'd already called the bank and so forth. Then he begins to lecture me on things he 'd previously told me. I had not made the same mistake. And why was my account even open to them when I had password protection? For some unknown reason they stopped asking what my password was. I had noted that when I called because the person answering the call did not ask me, nor the next person.  So at some point, and days later, I submitted an email to XXXX hoping he 'd READ it and understand. He has a one track mind, he simply said I am messing up. No I was not.

This user later contacted paypal making a claim that their identity was stolen and the transactions were unauthorized. However after submitting ID information and IP information for review by paypal their specialists determined that the claim was in fact false and all of the transactions were authorized.

Paypal said that I was not eligible for protection because XXXX are an intangible good. However XXXX are unique goods in that unlike other intangible items, such as music, videos or software, they are not a copy being sold but instead an actually item that was delivered to the buyer.

In addition to this, all of the sales were completed using the XXXX website which provides tracking and proof of delivery for all online sales. However paypal rejected this information.   Paypal did not even attempt to fight this fraud or give me the opportunity to fight it myself despite the compounding evidence against this other user. I believe that at the very least I should be provided with the reversal documents as proof that they were even made. Hiding the personal information of the user who made the reversal would be acceptable but providing no proof at all is not. Paypal is allowing people to commit blatant fraud and theft while not only doing nothing about it but also actively preventing me from helping myself.   ",agosnell@purdue.edu,0

He said he could only tell me what was marked on my account. He then transferred me to XXXX in Delinquency Control. She said my account was being treated as delinquent, and that the notes indicated I had caused them to lose money. I told her this was illegal.

So, the first part of the complaint is : I have yet to know whether they are illegally treating the debt as a delinquency and if there are still derogatory notes against me.  The second part of the complaint involves why I ended up filing for bankruptcy. I purchased my property in XXXX under a FHA loan. Then in XXXX I became XXXX and be XXXX I had used up most of my savings and was unable to work. I was living on social security. I had a secured line of credit against my property for {$67000.00}.

5236,"Dear Sir, MadamThursdays are one of my days off. It is also the days I get paid, late in the day to the wee hours of Friday from one of my jobs. Both of my paychecks have always deposited with JP Morgan. Last Thursday being almost virtually with no money but compelled to do my grocery shopping considering the fact that I will be back at my 14 hours a day schedule for the next three days ( Fridays, Saturdays and Sundays ), with no time to do those chores, I waited well into the afternoon and ran these errands. When I do this, JP Morgan Chase will substract the amount of my groceries shopping from the pay checks that were being deposited by my employers. Or this bank could decide to charge me. There is no clear rule as to why it has this option because JP Morgan Chase is the only party that is in the position to say when my checks were deposited and decide to charge penalties or not to charge penalties. And it did charge penalties, three times, last Thursday going into Friday. And it charged me penalties many times due to this fact that the bank is the only one to say whether or not deposits were made before the cut off time : penalties for overdraft on annuities, penalties on tax returns until the IRS issued specific recommendations. So, I believe the latest penalties JP Morgan charged me again are abusive and would like it to refund me those. I am not in a position to check the time it said my pay check was deposited into my account and I suspect many times JP Morgan delayed the time a deposit should be credited to my account in order to charge penalties.

XXXX '' When I contacted them after meeting the debit card requirement to verify I met that, and after my qualifying employer direct deposit went in about verifying that as well, I was told something else entirely. Regions now claims ( after I fulfilled the promotional terms ) that because I was a customer years ago that I do n't qualify for the offer. I have sent several messages informing them of their offer terms as advertised by them, and they still refuse to make good on the terms of the offer. Instead, they tell me to go to a branch, where I am certain I will be told there is nothing they can do. This is the exact text of the offer advertised : '' * Offer valid in select markets only ; including XXXX XXXX, MO, XXXX, TN, and XXXX, NC. {$200.00} bonus offer may not be combined with any other offer, does not apply if you already have a Regions checking account, only applies to personal XXXX checking accounts, and may be withdrawn at any time. To earn this bonus, you must meet all requirements of the offer described above within 60 days of opening your new account. If earned, the bonus will be issued within 120 days of meeting these requirements, and will be in the form of a credit to the new checking account, which must be open at the time the credit is issued. All XXXX checking accounts require a {$50.00} minimum opening deposit. The Annual Percentage Yield ( APY ) paid on LifeGreen Preferred Checking accounts is determined by account balance and, as of XX/XX/XXXX, was 0.01 % for all balances. Regions may change the APY at any time. Fees may reduce earnings on XXXX Preferred Checking accounts. No interest is paid on other XXXX checking accounts. A monthly fee may apply to your XXXX checking account, depending on account type, but this fee may be waived on some accounts if certain conditions are met. For accounts opened in Iowa, certain account fees are subject to Iowa State Tax of 6 %, which will be assessed at the time the fee is charged, unless exempt. Taxes are the responsibility of the recipient.  I am a resident of XXXX XXXX, MO, and was not currently a Regions customer before opening my checking account. I qualify for the offer. If Regions wanted to exclude those who have EVER had an account with them, that should have been stated in the offer terms.   ",zhan1565@purdue.edu,1
5239,"In late 2014, I removed overdraft protection services from a Wells Fargo checking account. I did so while going through tough financial times to avoid the large and onerous {$35.00} overdraft fees. Through my Wells Fargo debit card, I have multiple automatically re-occurring payments set up for services like XXXX, XXXX and XXXX streaming video services. In the past when my account balance has been insufficient to cover those transactions, they 've been denied by the bank as expected. I can point to specific instances on XXXX XXXX and XXXX where this occurred. Last month, on XXXX XXXX, a payment was submitted by XXXX for {$8.00} when my account balance was a negative balance of approximately {$240.00}. As expected, the payment was declined. On XXXX XXXX and XXXX, I made deposits to my account totalling {$220.00} to bring my account balance to about negative {$20.00}. On XXXX XXXX and XXXX, XXXX reoccurring payment were submitted for which my account balance was not sufficient. Contrary to my expectations, these payments were authorized and I was charged for XXXX seperate {$35.00} overdraft fees, a total of {$100.00}. In contacting Wells Fargo today, they were unable to provide any explanation of why these payments were authorized and overdraft fees were charged, contrary to what has occurred on my account in the past. The only suggestion they could provide was that perhaps the merchant/vendor had done something different with the payments. To that end, I contacted the customer service of a specific merchant ( XXXX ) to check to see the payment they submitted on XXXX XXXX differed in any way from previously pre-authorized payments. Per their customer service, it did not. I was also advised that XXXX submitted another pre-authorized payment attempt on XXXX XXXX which was also declined by Wells Fargo. So far in contacting Wells Fargo, I have been unable to determine either why payments in the past they claim should have been authorized were not, nor why payments these payments were authorized, despite of payments for the same amounts from the same vendors in the past being declined. I suspect, though can not confirm, that there exists some rule within Wells Fargo ( perhaps unknown to their customer service representatives ) that overdraft transactions are somehow authorized or declined based off of account balances.

In the past, the representation was/is that an electronic payment started on a particular day would reach and be credited by the payee the next day. The electronic process is quick ; that it might take a day arises from the fact that payer must send, then payee must examine the  package '', i.e. XXXX separate electronic processes : sending is completed the day of sending, examination of package by payee is done the same day or the next day. Thus, sending should be complete on the day of payment, crediting should be done either that same day if payee is entitled to use the funds that day or by the next day if entitled to use them the next day. There is no reason for further delay, and banks accepting electronic payments must do so promptly. Recently, I have been charged late fees and interest by Bank of America and XXXX credit cards when evidence likely shows the sending was electronically done well before the due date, i.e. these credit card companies insist on crediting the day after so their computers can charge hefty late fees and interest. Meanwhile, the sending bank ( XXXX bill payment ) is now changing, without warning, its description of electronic bill payment to the effect that electronic payment will take 2 business days beyond the day of sending ( i.e. not counting the day of electronic sending ). This is not only unreasonable but collusion with other banks delaying crediting to charge late fees and interest. It is unreasonable because : Question  gt ; What is the sending bank doing on the day of sending electronically [ Note, these are recurring monthly payments, so the bank knows weeks in advance when to start ] if not sending an electronic package which arrives somewhere the same day? It should not take 2 extra business days for the receiving bank to examine the electronic package electronically. The one extra day allowed in the past is more than enough, and receiving banks should credit payment either the day of actual electronic receipt or actual availability of electronic funds which is the same day anyway [ just like a check is supposed to have sufficient funds when issued, an electronic payment should have sufficient funds also ]. The problems arose with electronic payments scheduled for a Friday with a credit card due date of Monday, with receiving bank ( Bank of America and XXXX credit cards ) crediting payment and charging late fee and interest on Tuesday. When informed of this development, XXXX now changes its representation that it would not be liable until 2 business days after, i.e. not counting the day of sending, this is collusion with the receiving banks. An electronic transaction started on Friday should not take til Tuesday. A receiving bank knows THE SUM TOTAL of the package on Friday and can use those funds on Friday even before it distributes fund into each separate account. There is no reason why it should not credit the separate accounts by Monday, even retroactively if necessary. Whereas XXXX was previously willing to inform the receiving banks that the electronic payment was started on Friday, now it says it has no duty to help for any due date until ( i.e. falling before ) Wednesday.

You ( someone at Ally XXXX said there was no way to opt out of this and also no way to avoid a fee if using the debit card were to overdraft the account. Are you sure about this?

From that day forward, a new Federal Reserve rule will prohibit banks from charging overdraft protection fees unless a customer opts in. Overdraft protection is a service offered by banks that allows checking account holders to temporarily make purchases with a debit card even if they do n't have sufficient funds in their account to cover them. In effect, the bank makes a shortterm loan to the account holder so his debit card is n't declined at the register or an ATM machine. In return, the bank charges an overdraft fee of {$10.00} to {$35.00}, according to an informal XXXX survey.

When asked they said they checked it every morning only.  I really have no complaint with the bank other than that they sent a replacement card to another person at another address and the only notification I had was the {$5.00} charge followed by the attempted thefts.

The supervisor on duty agreed to waive two months worth of fees but would not agree to waive all of the charges.

After several emails and phone calls, someone looked at the trail and determined that the incoming wire transfer came through XXXX bank and SunTrust received {$9100.00}.

Chase 's bait-and-switch in scamming a senior citizen to route his Social Security income warrants a federal investigation.   FACTS : In response to a mailed Chase promotion of {$500.00} bonus for new accounts, my daughter helped me, an elderly man on a fixed income, open a checking account and savings account at the Fishers, IN branch on XXXX XXXX 2015. For opening the checking account w/ a minimum of {$25.00} deposit and direct deposit within 30 days, Chase offered a {$300.00} bonus within 10 business days of the first direct deposit. For a savings account with {$15000.00} average balance for 90 days, Chase offered {$200.00}.   I used my Social Security monthly income for my direct deposit which was credited on XXXX XXXX 2015. It is now XXXX XXXX 2015 and Chase still has not deposited the {$300.00} bonus. Repeated attempts by my daughter via several emails and numerous phone calls with the banker who opened the account, his manager, and the XXXX branch manager have been extremely frustrating and unsuccessful. This is a simple straightforward resolution for a technical problem caused by the Chase banker XXXX who failed to enter the promotion code from the physical promotion mailed card that we brought in to open the account and qualify for the bonus. Now the banker alleges that he does n't recall our using the promotion! My wife opened XXXX accounts using the exact same promotion ( but a different card with a different code ) the day before! In further support of the banker XXXX 's incompetence, when he opened my account, he called my daughter a wk later b/c he forgot to take the signature card we signed and he needed me to bring it back to the bank.   My daughter who is a joint acct holder has spoken to the Chase banker directly and even to his managers in XXXX, IN, who refuse to correct the problem even after they can see that I satisfied the qualifications for the bonus -- direct deposit within 30 days of opening the account. This has gone on for two weeks! Chase even demanded that I return to the branch for a third time to return something that the banker failed to do -- the promotion card with the code on the back. I brought in the card to Chase bank and they still refuse to correct their error and credit my account the {$300.00} bonus I rightfully earned.   Chase has misrepresented its promotion, failed to honor its promise of a {$300.00} cash bonus after I satisfied the qualifications for it, and has given me and my daughter the run-around instead of immediately correcting its error.  Chase employees ' actions which we 've documented are unconscionable and are tantamount to elder fraud and abuse. Chase eagerly changed my Social Security income direct deposit from a bank where I 'm familiar with a false promise that it would take care of my financial needs. But now Chase refuses to honor its promise by crediting my acct for the bonus I clearly earned and no one from Chase will do his/her job. This should 've been corrected three wks ago but Chase and its employees keep giving me and my daughter excuses and promises to follow up and call but then failing to do so. Out of fear, we closed out the savings account b/c we were afraid that Chase would hang onto it for the 90 days and refuse to pay that {$200.00} bonus as well.

I have been informed repeatedly that they are unable to do either because I would be required to go to a branch and get this done. This does not sound reasonable to me. They insist they have no way to honor my request without my in personal appearance period and that there is no protocol to handle customers who move to a state where there are no branches of their bank.  Having traveled alot in my life and have held many bank accounts in many states where I was able to close my accounts remotely these answers seem very odd to me. Infact, sound flawed or at least completely wrong. I have requested to speak to the Branch Manager in California where the account was opened but have never warranted a transfer to her extension.  Please help me get my accounts closed with them. They refuse to honor my request. I have offered to send them a notarized statement ... they say they will not accept it. I have offered to establish a POA with my sister to close this account ... they say I need to be there to submit the POA. I can not win because these people are not practicing ethical banking. Please help me rid myself from them before they completely tank my credit. At this moment they are continuing to charge me bank fees. I will not put any money in their accounts because of their excessive fees and weird posting practices. Now they have me in a negative cycle where they continue to charge me for being over drawn for a particular period ... it could be an every day charge or every 3 day charge I am not certain.

PLEASE CALL IMMEDIATELY ''. This made the letter look as if I had a problem with my credit union account.  * The letter stated  Due to recent guideline changes '' again a reference that made it seem as if the letter was from the credit union as it did not identify who made the guideline changes* The letter indicated there would be a high volume of calls and to reference my account number when I call. This is a method to make it look like it is a credit union account number.  * The letter references a rate reduction  program '' and uses word program without going into detail as to what it constitutes other than a lower rate or whose program it was.

He kept asking me to buy his XXXX XXXX also, and showed me proof that he has been making money with his XXXX XXXX. So we made a deal, he told me to send him {$1500.00}, which I made it into XXXX transactions, XXXX is {$1300.00} and the other XXXX is {$150.00}.

On our last telephone communication XXXX XXXX, he told me that I will have to wait ANOTHER 30 days. Then before this same conversation ended, he said it would take another 30 to 60 days. He kept changing the information/data he was giving me as we talked.  - I believe I should have already received the {$1000.00} bonus by now since it is past 90 days from when I have fulfilled ALL the requirements of the promotion, including keeping all said accounts open and in GOOD standing.  2 ) XXXX XXXX managed to mislead me and my husband by opening XXXX checking accounts, when for the purposes of the above promotion, ONLY XXXX checking account was required to be opened. I communicated my concern that there have been XXXX checking accounts opened, instead of just XXXX, which was what we intended. He told me not to worry about it - that he usually opens XXXX accounts for clients, since the second account would come free anyway. Because I did not want to jeopardize the conditions of the promotion, I did not close the extra ( XXXX ) checking account.

I called in and spoke with a telephone banker and teh banker was able to reverse those charges for me over the phone as well as a extended overdraft fee that was also a result of the original overdraft. A day later ( unbeknownst to me ) Huntington reversed the refund off my account. This caused other OD fees when I used my debit card. Huntington now says the charges are my fault when my statement ( screenshot attached ) clearly shows the errors.   ",lo31@purdue.edu,1

I called the bank and asked them to cancel the transfer. While on the phone with the representative XXXX more transfers came through. The representative had asked if I had called in earlier in the day, because they showed that someone had called in. Someone had stolen my account information and was accessing my account. Even though I called right after and during the time the transfers were posted the bank was not able to stop the transfers and I had to file a claim. Throughout the process I was told that it could take up to 10 days for there to be a resolution and the money returned to me. My claim was filed on XXXX and as of today XXXX the money still has not been returned to me.

It is not a lot of money but I think this fee is uncalled for. I have requested a refund and so far have been denied. I have told them that I will be closing this account if the fee is not cancelled and refunded.  I guess these days one can not contest the 19 % but it does seem to be very high.

5849,"I am a Chase customer. I was very disappointed with Chase ' services twice. First was when I set up a payment on an auto insurance company ( XXXX ) on a specific date in which I am 100 % sure I will get enough funds on that day because it 's payday. When XXXX attempted to push thru the payment, the bank denied the payment. XXXX tried twice to get the payment but was denied by Chase, twice. I spoke to several Chase bank specialists and they were all saying that there are no trace of XXXX payment placed on that day. On the other hand, XXXX was claiming they attempted to get the payment twice on that day but was declined by Chase. I was caught in between and Chase did not help me resolve this issue, I ended up paying DMV a lapse of my insurance due to XXXX canceling my auto insurance. XXXX cancelled my insurance because Chase did not provide any proof that I have enough funds in that account. Although my bank statement shows that I did have the funds, but XXXX is not accepting it because they needed a letter head from Chase stating that it was a Bank error. Chase refused to help me with that. I was left unanswered with my confusion that time. A month later, I also have a tuition fee with a huge amount scheduled. I knew I did not have enough funds on the scheduled date and I did not have any opportunity to cancel the scheduled auto-payment since it was done online ( and no options were shown ). I was expecting that Chase would deny that payment since I did not have enough funds in bank, like what happened to the XXXX incident last month. To my surprise, my bank was overdrawn. The payment went thru. I did not understand what 's going on. I called chase again and they can not give me any answers. I had to undergo so many hassle just because of the same situation but with different solutions. Although Chase helped me to stop the payment made, they did not even apologize for this inconvenience. The second frustration i have for Chase was when they closed my account without giving me prior notice. They did not call nor email me with this matter. Today is Monday and also my payday, so I went to go shop for XXXX presents and was embarrassed by the counter upon paying because my debit card was declined. Ofcourse, I double checked my funds and I have {$400.00} available balance to spend. I called chase again and they were saying that my account was closed and they can not undo it because they needed my SSN verification. I opened my account about 5 years ago and they did not require my SSN. It 's very upsetting to return the gifts I was supposed to purchase because I was not informed about closed my checking account. When I spoke to the specialist, she was sarcastic and rude, as if she was annoyed by my inquiries. I totally did not understand why they have to close my account for that reason and without a notice. They said they mailed a notice but I did not receive any. And also, if my account was closed, why did my cheque was deposited to my account and why the teller in the Chase branch did not inform me about my closed account? My Chase mobile app is showing that my account is still active and I can still view my account activities and balance. There are no signs or ways that I can tell that my bank account was closed until I swiped my card. Imagine when I was at a restaurant and I had to pay the food I just ate. This is not fair. My complaint for chase is that they are not consistent and they are misleading their clients. They do not give proper information and notice. They do not provide good costumer services and they do not think of what the customer will feel or will go through because of their mistakes. I am not a happy camper here. This should not be happening.   ",xie188@purdue.edu,1

Specifically, in going through my records in order to better understand how I could resolve ongoing identity theft, I discovered that when applying for a bank account at Scottrade Bank, Scottrade Bank improperly handled a number of documents which had very personal information on them. The actions of Scottrade Bank not only broke from the current standards of data security but also broke Scottrade Bank 's internal policies regarding handling customer information.   Specifically, on or around XX/XX/2013 ( XXXX XXXX ), XXXX XXXX, a regional manager from Scottrade Bank offered to receive Scottrade Bank account application documents via email.

The XX/XX/2013 email contained PDF attachments that included my full name, signature, address, bank account numbers, Social Security Number, and other very personal and sensitive information.

5878,"I am a joint owner on my parents account, they both recently died, XXXX and XXXX. I personally went to the Bank of America in XXXX, Texas XXXX ( XXXX XXXX XXXX # XXXX ) to ask what the status of the account was since my parents passed away. I was told since my name was on the account I could do whatever I wanted with the account and they would remove my parents names. I mailed copies of both death certificates to BOA as requested and then BOA sent me a new signature card to sign so only my name would be on the account, which they now have. In the meantime I was paying any bills that needed paying for my parents. During that XXXX month period I personally deposited {$1000.00} of my own money and my brother deposited {$5000.00} to the account to make sure there was money to cover any medical bills. I was told I was in control of this account or I would have handled the final expenses and deposits differently. Two months later on XXXX/XXXX/XXXX I see that there is a hold on the account of {$1200.00} and {$2200.00} - I called on XXXX/XXXX/XXXX and was told they were holding 50 % of the account for my Mom and 25 % for my date to cover any interest paid by the bank ( total interest paid in XXXX was {$0.00} ) so this makes no since to hold {$3500.00} for interest paid by the bank. I was also told on this call that the account was not set up with Right of Survivorship which up to this point I had not been told in person or on the phone. Also they have now tied my hands to pay any unforeseen bills that come in. All of my parents other assets were controlled by their trust but because we had the understanding that this account was under my control there was no need to include this account in the trust or probate their will. We were utilizing this account for end of life expenses. BOA is telling me the only option I have to get this money released is to Probate their will just for this checking account. BOA for two months gave me incorrect information in the Bank and on the phone because I also called and verified if I needed to do anything with this account or did I have control of it and was told YES. The bank should allow any surviving accountholder to continue to use the account to transact business after the death of another accountholder. We have an executed will and an executed trust that defines all asset distributions for my parents estate that should be sufficient to release these funds. I took all the right steps to notify BOA and now am being penalized because of BOA 's misinformation.

She said most people opt-in online. She could n't explain why I did n't get the disclosures but put me on hold to talk to XXXX at the branch. When the person came back she said XXXX would mail the overdraft disclosures to me. XXXX mailed me the handbook and privacy policy but no overdraft disclosure or confirmation.   I went to close my account on XXXX/XXXX/15 the Service Manager XXXX XXXX told me that I would be charged a fee if I closed my account, but I could talk to a banker to see about waiving the fee. I explained I was closing my account because they were n't complying with the regulations. The supervisor did n't care to ask what the violation was and he refused to let me withdraw the {$100.00} that was in my account. I was forced to go talk to the same banker who does n't understand overdrafts to get the account closing fee waived and then go back to the teller line to wait for a cashier 's check. I deposited cash and asked for cash to be returned to me, why was I forced to get a cashier 's check. It is hugely surprising that a supervisor is unable to waive a fee or did n't care about the details of a regulatory violation.   I think this is a problem that has impacted several other customers. The personal banker does n't give out the deposit account agreement unless a person is forceful like I was. He tried to tell me the XXXX page  Individual Signature Card '' was the agreement. Even after I read the sentence about acknowledging receipt of the Handbook, he was unsure for what I was looking. Neither the personal banker nor the call center agent and XXXX understand what the required process is to comply with the Regulation E overdraft regulations. Then, when I point out their noncompliance and my desire to close my account, they want to charge me a fee. Please protect others ' consumer rights by looking into these overdraft practices.

The representative said she was only taking the report and we could speak to someone in another department regarding that. Once the report was completed she transferred us to another department and we were never given a clear answer why something like this was not caught sooner by the bank and the account put on hold until resolved. Instead, my son never received a return call, he called them and was told he was being held responsible and they no longer wanted to do business with him. They gave him no reason or supporting information on what they found during their investigation. He requested this information and was sent from department to department until he was frustrated and hung up. He sent written requests asking for their findings after the investigation and they never responded. Instead, the following day after they received the second set of written requests, they closed his account. This was just very unexpected from USAA because I have been a loyal customer for over 20 years and they have always provided the best customer service.

6050,"What happened was about a little over 2 years ago right before thanksgiving I had an attorney trust account at td bank under the name XXXX XXXX, XXXX. trustee. I also opened a new business account for XXXX with the ein number of XXXX. I had received a debit card for both accounts. my attorney trust account was the account i has all my money in. however, i received a call on a late Thursday or Friday afternoon that my attorney trust debit card had been canceled from ny where i opened the account, but the debit card was issue at my home branch in XXXX, fl. due to this I had no money and was not able to go to the bank until Saturday night or Sunday. The reason the banker called from ny was that is was improper for a trust account to have a debit card which i was using at all the td branch banks in XXXX and XXXX with the bankers knowing the debit card came to my attorney trust accocunt. After that, Saturday night i had become XXXX and i had become destitute and was without any money for lodging, gas, and so forth. i called one of the customer service from my phone, the call got escalated and I was helped by a gentleman who authorized overdraft protection for my XXXX account. I went to bank a few times on the overdraft suggestion of this banker. That solution did help me take out money, however I took out money a couple times and the next few days I saw lots of overdraft charges. I called the customer service and they denied me any credits for the bank canceling my card and forcing me to overdraft my account to have money instead of being destitute and have charges. I went to the branch where I opened the account and continuously got the run around and no answers about rectifying the overdrafts and was treated in such a disrespectful way. After that I did not pay anything I owed the bank on that account since they would not rectify the overdraft charges since they incorrectly or illegally issued a debit card to a trust account. Shortly after this, I ended up having some family and personal issues which I directed my attention to and had in mind to try to write the cfpb about this issue since I had on XXXX previous occasion had written the cfpb and had a positive outcome.

Today on XXXX XXXX, 2016 I went one last time and asked at my branch in XXXX, fl about trying to look up this account and fix this issue. The branch manager took my number and said she would call me to follow up today.

I am requesting that this account be opened back up, put in good standing, and any fees that were paid for overdraft charges in this chevy river warehouse, llc account be credited back to the bank account, and in addition the bank should clear my name from check systems or any other flag they put me on or my business accounts.

To add insult to injury, BOA is charging monthly fees for the funds I ca n't access, and wants to charge me a fee to close the account so that I can move the funds elsewhere.  Long Description : On XXXX XXXX, 2015, I contacted Bank of America via email with questions about opening an HSA account. A representative responded, and I followed that up with a phone call during which I was told to go to my local branch to open the HSA account. About 3 weeks later, when I had time to go during banking hours, I set an appointment ; the appointment form indicated I was coming in to open an HSA account. I arrived on time for the appointment. After waiting about 30 minutes I finally interrupted a bank officer walking through the lobby to ask what was happening and when my appointment would be met. She checked and indicated they had no record of an appointment but I had the printout showing the appointment. At that time she found someone to meet with me, and that person advised me that they could not open an HSA as it could only be done online. So, I went back home and XXXX I went ahead and opened the account on online.  I subsequently received a letter in the mail, dated XXXX XXXX, advising me that the account was open and I would shortly receive a XXXX debit card which could be used to pay for health care expenses. I waited patiently but no card arrived. After a while ( not sure the date ), I called and was told the card had been mailed, but they could create and mail another card. The representative explained that it had been sent in a plain white envelope, so maybe I missed it. I told her I would recheck before having them send another card. Both my husband and I checked every piece of mail that had come in and there was no card. So, I called back and asked to have a new card sent. I was told it would be 7-10 business days. I waited this period and called after no card was received. BOA agreed to send another card. I waited and when no card came I called again. The first person who responded told me it was about a week to get the new card ready and then 7-10 business days after it was mailed. I was later told that it was 7-10 business days from the date of the request. So, I waited still longer, and again no card. I called again.I asked if I could get a card on an expedited basis as this was getting to be a real problem, and was told there was no such process available ; I needed to wait a few more days, or they could send another card and that would be another 7-10 days. So, I waited more, but again no card arrived.  On XXXX XXXX I called and told them I was desperate. I spoke with  XXXX '' who agreed that he would apply for a new card to be prepared on an expedited basis. XXXX promised that he would have someone call me the next morning ( he was off in the morning ) to confirm the expedited card. No call came that morning. At XXXX in the afternoon of XXXX XXXX XXXX called me and explained that folks had been busy and he had been in for about an hour not able to call. He then advised that BOA had agreed to expedite the card and I should receive it in 3-5 business days. So, I waited and checked the mail every day. No card arrived on the XXXX business day ( XXXX XXXX ). After much rigmarole he advised that the card had been produced on an expedited basis but things fell through the cracks and it sat at the production site and was not actually mailed until XXXX XXXX. Further he advised that the expedited part was how fast the card was produced but it was still sent regular mail.

6085,"TD Bank has charged an overdraft fee for a situation in which we make a check deposit minus  cash ''. If there is not a balance in your existing checking account ( pre-deposit ) to cover the  cash '' portion that you are taking from your deposit, they charge an overdraft fee.  I understand that technically you are taking money off of a check that has not yet cleared so essentially you are taking withdrawal from you checking account but that is NOT explained to you at the time you are standing with the teller making the transaction. You do n't find out until you see the overdraft fee and call the bank to understand where its coming from.  The complaint is regarding a deceptive practice. Its fine if the policy is as it is but it should be the teller 's responsibility to tell the customer that they do n't have the money in their checking account to cover the withdrawal so they can either choose to take it against an alternative account that has the funds or they can take a lesser amount so they do not incur the fee, otherwise they will incur the fee.

6158,"Before leaving for an extended stay in another country, I contacted Santander Bank to let them know that I would be in a certain city for 9 weeks and wanted to make sure that there would be no problem using my debit card at the Santander ATM in the city I would be staying in.

So, basically, Santander Bank is holding my funds hostage while I am in another country, unable to get the card that is sitting in a pile of mail at home.

I can not believe that Santander activated a new card and deactivated the card I currently have with no notice or input from me. I thought it was up to the consumer to activate a new card. The fact that Santander is unwilling to even try to help me is unacceptable. I am sure that I am not the only consumer who has been left stranded without access to their funds while out of the country. How could this possible be legal????

Unbeknown to me, the Manager on duty had placed a hold on my account where I would n't receive my funds when they cleared but almost 12 days later.

It was n't until around XXXX XXXX that we started get answers when a boyfriend of a friend came forward and told us that he knew his boyfriend had been using our information and cards and that he had several convictions against him for credit card fraud and being in caught possession with other peoples credit and or debit cards. The boyfriend of our friend who was doing this to us left a message for the boyfriend were he admitted using us and others and did n't care. He was also renting out his garage to well over 6 homeless or other people and taking their SSI checks. The person who had been stealing from us also had someone show up XXXX at our door which a neighbor saw this and called the police. As well he started many disturbances knowing that we were going to be filing a police report. The loss was greater than we could even imagine around end of XXXX it was around {$20000.00} plus. We also found out the person who had been getting into our accounts had an operation running credit cards from state to state. We knew very little if nothing about account tampering, credit card fraud or anything of the like, so XXXX XXXX called USAA to warn them of all that was going on and that the person doing this had got into our accounts and we were unclear of what they could do to any other accounts at USAA as we said we were just learning about dealing with this stuff.

As he proceeded to tell her what was going on I could hear her shriek while waking me up and causing me to go into the other room, she said WHAT DO YOU WANT FROM US. Only she did not use those words. They were much more harsh. And proceeded to rant. It took quite a while for XXXX to explain our situation and that we were calling to let them know what was going on with our accounts and wanted warn them in case the person who done this could harm any other USAA customers with the information we had. After a while of going back and forth, she finally said for us to go to police station fill out a report and let them know what charges were not ours from checking account.   ",flanagak@purdue.edu,0

6406,"After having a banking relationship with Chase for many years, my checking account became used by someone utilizing ACH or international wire transfers. It may have happened after my computers got stolen during a burglary at my home just prior.

I was notified only transactions within a 60 day period would qualify, and although there were a few just touching, or outside that period, I understood the  timely manor '' issue. Even though, I was somewhat relying on the police to find the fingerprints, and catch whomever it was.  The trouble began on my very first call XXXX XXXX, to report the fraud, the representative only took XXXX item down, to file as fraud. In reality we discussed about XXXX-XXXX transactions. At this point my account had been over drafted XXXX dollars! She told me within 3 days I would see a provisional credit during the investigation, and then paperwork to fill out. 3 days went by, and only XXXX credit was applied, and spent several hours with several reps, adding the additional money transfers one by one. They ( for some reason ) created a case for each item.  I complied with their request for information, and the forms signed. I was issued a credit, later to find out, that there were still fraud transactions being processed through my account, from the same company. I called to notify them, and an agent in the disputes department,  XXXX '' decided that all these were valid charges somehow ( almost {$5000.00} ) even though I have never in my life performed an international money transfer. I explained about the break in, she stated she did not care, she was reversing every credit previously applied. I asked her why? It seemed very personal, she became angry, short, and rude, and told me she believed I did the transactions. It was a complete nightmare, of chaos, disorganization, and mistakes from representatives from then on, until my account was closed, without notice, because I told them they were violating the Fair billing act.

6418,I have XXXX recent issues with TD Bank regarding XXXX different accounts. Both complaints have to do with excessive charging of fees. The first is TD Bank assessed charges against an estate account which dipped below {$100.00} as I was in the process of closing the estate and account. The fees they charged caused the account to go into the negative. that is the only thing that caused the account to go negative. I fought that and got most ( but not all ) of the charges reversed. The 2nd item involved TD Bank clearing unauthorized charges against a business account which put the account into the negative and then charging fees for being overdrawn which made the negative balance larger. I was unsuccessful in fighting TD on reversing these charges and had to deposit {$65.00} to bring the balance to XXXX. At this point I closed the account to stop the madness. When I again tried to get charges reversed I was told they could n't do anything about a closed account. All of this is deceptive and designed to extract fees from consumers. ,afrances@purdue.edu,0

My wife thought the bill was from the XXXX XXXX. branch and paid it for the last 3 years When I rented the box on XXXX XXXX, I also opened a savings account which they deducted the rent annually. When the amount in the account dropped below the rental amt., they deducted the balance and created a overdrawn situation. They, in turn, have charged me a penalty along with some type of interest charge for approximately {$50.00} and are currently saying I own {$110.00}. In calculating the penalty, they have pyramided the bill which is against the law.

6475,"I have recently been the victim of a series of fraudulent charges, all in relatively small amounts between $ XXXX-XXXX, over the course of the months from XX/XX/XXXX - XX/XX/XXXX. I became aware of these charges on XX/XX/XXXX, after the criminals had slowly drained my business account of over {$6000.00}.   When I finally realized what had been happening, I reported it immediately to my financial institution, Chase, at my local branch in XXXX XXXX, CA on XXXX XXXX. They could see quite clearly that the charges were fraudulent and expected the funds to be returned in a couple days.   On XXXX XXXX, I received an email that {$3900.00} would be transferred into my account ( already far short of the approximately {$6500.00} due ). Later that day I received notice that my claim was denied. I have escalated this to the extent of my ability and have received nothing positive whatsoever. Chase is telling me directly that their refusal to refund is my responsibility, as I should 've reported far earlier - this of course, dependent on knowing what happened, and I did n't.   A bit more explanation : The charges were all from a XXXX station in XXXX, CA - a place I 've never been. I do, however, buy gas, etc ... at XXXX in XXXX XXXX, so if I see  XXXX - {$65.00} '' on a statement, I do n't think anything of it. Simply not an odd charge.   Chase has informed me that my claim is invalid because the original charges were more than 35 days prior to me reporting them, which they claim is backed up by federal regulations that were in effect 9 years ago when I opened the account, something I doubt very much.   They also claim that because I accessed my account online via the QuickPay app on my phone, that I must have NECESSARILY seen these charges and just neglected to report them, something that defies all reason. I use that app to quickly pay my rent and my doctor.   Chase fully encourages the use of mobile banking, making it exceedingly easy to miss individual charges like I did. Chase also encourages electronic statements available online. I do n't receive my statement in the mail, nor do I receive it in email. An email that states it 's  available to view '' is n't the same as having the text in your face.   Yet they are adamant that even though they 've found multiple ways to discourage their customers from actually tracking their transactions, it 's still the customer 's fault to do so - in the course of our conversations they 've even said that fraud must be reported in 24 hours in some cases. Who lives their lives like this?   As it stands now, they are telling me they ca n't return a huge amount of money ( to me ) because of when the undeniably fraudulent activity began longer than 35 days prior to my reporting, and they imply that I was somehow complicit in it by 'knowing ' and not reporting it. They also tell me that even the charges within the 35 days prior to my reporting are denied.   All of this is premised on the idea that the funds are unrecoverable. That is clearly contradictory.. If they have 35 days, they could 've recovered at least those funds. They chose not to act at all for 31 days. Also, since all of the fraud was of the same variety and from the same source, if they 're able to track and recover the most recent charges, they certainly should be well within legal reasoning to recover the rest. Instead they 're completely obstinate in the face of a customer complaint.   I 've been a Chase business customer for 9 years. I 've had them alert me of fraudulent charges in the past, and I 've also noticed some myself and have had to report them. They 've left my account exposed repeatedly.   Their ONLY job is to protect my money and provide the services I need. They 've done neither, and in turn they 've blamed it on me.

It is now XXXX XXXX, XXXX, and I have paid {$90.00} total in monthly fees to Citi, and Citi has not upheld its side of the promotion. Citi now claims that I was never eligible for the promotion, despite the fact that they confirmed my eligibility several times and provided specific dates and milestones that correlated to that eligibility.

The last Citibank rep I spoke with told me that the points would post within 90 days of meeting the requirements. Only now, after they have collected fees for 90 days of waiting, did Citi decide to inform me that I am not eligible. If I was ineligible, why was I not informed earlier? I understand that Citibank reserves the right to 'target ' specific customers for promotional offers, however, the onus is then also on them screen applicants who apply for their eligibility for said offers.

They let me attempt to use the card and be forced to contact them to find out what was going on when the account did not work.

The second was that the account was overdrawn and that because the I made the deposit through the ATM that the atm automatically held it for XXXX days. The third was that since I deposit the check yesterday but it was dated for today they held it to make sure the funds would post.

In the process, I had applied to many different jobs, some could be directly applied to on XXXX and others you had to set up separate accounts and apply through those agencies. I got notification from a company called XXXX they conducted an interview, had me take a test of skills  abilities, and then hired me. I got notification saying,  CONGRATULATIONS, XXXX is pleased to offer you the position of an XXXX. You 're Hired '' I asked them certain questions about wanting to meet with them in person, wanting to meet with my training supervisors, wanting to have a video conference. There answers to this was,  Once you receive your working materials, a representative will be coming to your home to inspect your working materials and discuss any issues you will be having. As we proceed further you get to know more about the job and its duties. '' So this did seem little little disguised and not as straight forward as I would like ; however, I decided to give them the benefit of the doubt since I did n't want to blindly assume this was a fraudulent activity. So, with my skepticism, I chose to just take this job one step at a time, to not commit myself to anything that seemed fraudulent, deceptive, or misleading, and to try to use the advice of my banking institution to help me make my assessment and judgment in pursuing my career. This company, XXXX said they were going to send me out a check to purchase the computer hardware  software that I had to have for the tracking of this in-home accounting position to track my hours and send my work that I do. I received the cashier 's checks which turned out to be 3 checks from 3 different people from two different organizations, with letters from 3 different financial managers telling me what to do with the funds ( deposit them and report back to them ). Then they told me to purchase the hardware from the their corporate vendor to whom they have all their employees conduct their business through. So, one step at a time, I explained my situation to the to the banking manager. They told me,  It sounds a little fishy .... I would n't even deposit the checks! '' I asked the banking manager,  But, is n't there any way that I could take a more secured manner of approach without completely abandoning my new employment opportunity under a mere assumption that it might not be legitimate? '' But, they refused to advise me any further. So what was I supposed to do? Tell my new employer to go fly a kite and get lost just because my bank had told me,  I do n't know it sounds a little fishy to me? '' I kept thinking,  Is n't there a way that I could test this hypothesis without committing myself to fraud if it existed but not abandoning my new employment opportunity? '' So I decided to deposit the cashier 's checks to see if they were legitimate. After all, they were cashier 's checks, and I could n't be charged a fee for NSF if that was the case! The first cashier 's check cleared so I thought that there must be some legitimacy there! '' But I come to find out a few days later that I had two deficit balances of $ XXXX  $ XXXX in checking  savings, respectively. My accounts were closed. I spoke to the bank manager. She refused to help me but told me to take it up with the human resources department at the bank. Ultimately, they, too, would n't do anything else to assist me in getting to the bottom of this matter. They claimed my account had been closed, that I could no longer bank at this institution, that this would go on my credit record, and that I might not be able to bank with anyone else. Why did n't they just assist me from the beginning in taking some extra preventative steps to hold the checks until they did clear? ",flanagak@purdue.edu,0

They suspended my account, were slow in responding to me and caused me to accrue fees from my bills because the account was suspended and thus the funds did not go through.

As a result, I have been dealing with this situation for three months with no resolution. As the chain of events are read, I 'm perplexed as there is no process in place for situations like this. I 'm certain I 'm not the first or will be the last person to be faced with this issue. Additionally, I realize the amount is minimal but at this point it 's the principle of not having a process in place and someone other than my son received {$140.00}.  Chain of Events : 1. Took advantage of the process to send my son money ( a XXXX who resides in XXXX ) from my XXXX account to his Chase checking account via the XXXX XXXX vendor ( which was solicited through accessing my XXXX account ). This amount was for {$140.00} and sent on XXXX/XXXX/2016. The funds were immediately debited from my account.  2. My son accepted the transfer and completed a profile with XXXX XXXX to complete the process.  3. My son and I received notification the funds were available as of XXXX/XXXX/2016. However, when my son checked his account, the funds were never transferred as confirmed.  4. I contacted XXXX advising of the issue and was advised the funds were successfully transferred, to wait a few more days, and call back if the funds are yet to be transferred.  5. I waited and no transfer to my son 's Chase account. I called XXXX back and was advised I needed to contact Chase with tracking number, XXXX to see if they could track where the funds transferred.  6. My son and I called Chase on a conference call and explained the situation, the representative confirmed the funds did not transfer and advised they could n't help. The representative suggested to file a claim with my bank ( XXXX ). I advised I took those actions already hence the reason for the call. The representative laughed and advised I must be clear on advising my bank I need to file an ACH claim.  7. I called XXXX again and advised of the situation. I was then advised there was absolutely nothing they could do and I needed to call the vendor for resolution.  8. My son and I called the vendor on a conference call and was advised they could n't assist with a resolution and I needed to call my bank and/or Chase. I advised both actions were taken hence the reason we are contacting them. The representative then advised they would attempt to look into it but unlikely they 'd be able to assist.  9. My son nor I heard back from the vendor as advised, so I decided to send an online inquiry to XXXX requesting to open an ACH claim as I 've been going back and forth with all parties with no resolution.  10. After several online inquiries, XXXX submitted a claim with the vendor for further research.  11. A month went by without a response or resolution. I sent another online inquiry to XXXX and received a response indicating there was nothing the vendor could do and I needed to contact Chase for resolution. I advised again that my son and I went down that route with no resolution. The XXXX representative working my claim attempted to contact Chase directly but was advised there was nothing they could do unless possibly my son, myself, XXXX and Chase are on a conference call. I advised at this time with my son 's and my schedule it would be too challenging to attempt to coordinate such a call. Also, I 've spent too much time already attempting to resolve this matter with all parties as suggested.

6742,"On Monday afternoon, XXXX XXXX, 2016, I telephoned State Farm Bank ( FDIC insured ) to open a traditional IRA account over the phone. ( State Farm Bank advertised its rates CD rates on the internet ). I spoke with a customer service rep who said he was an IRA specialist. I explained that I wanted to transfer funds from an already existing traditional IRA at a different bank, and would also be making a 2016 contribution to the new State Farm Bank IRA account. The service rep said that he would help me open the IRA account. He said that he would be filling out the application form on the phone and would be asking me a series of questions. During the next 30 minutes, I was asked the standard questions ( e.g., name, address, ss #, date of birth, type of IRA, dollar amount I would be contributing, tax withholding status, beneficiary info, whether to mail a check or have the current IRA trustee transfer the funds, etc. ). At the very end of the application process, I was told that the State Farm Bank service rep would be choosing a local State Farm insurance agent whose name would be added to my IRA account as my insurance agent contact. I objected to having a stranger 's name listed as part of my IRA account. I said that I did not want any insurance agent 's name noted on my account, my application, my bank records, or my application form. I asked why he wanted to put a local State Farm insurance agent on my bank records, and he said that it was for marketing and sales purposes to advise me of the State Farm 's products. I told him I already had insurance, had my own insurance agent, did n't want any solicitations from State Farm, and said that I was declining have a local State Farm insurance agent 's name listed as contact for my IRA account. The State Farm Bank service rep stated that he could not complete my IRA application form and State Farm Bank, as a matter of policy, could not open a bank account for me without having their insurance agent 's name indicated on the records of my bank account. I said that there were no federal banking laws that required me to have the name of an insurance agent noted on my IRA account. He replied that without a State Farm insurance agent listed on my IRA account records, I would not be allowed to open a bank account at State Farm Bank. He stated that it was bank policy to require this, and that the requirement to have their local insurance agent listed on my IRA account records complied with all federal laws. I asked him to bring his supervisor into the conversation so that I could  opt out '' of this requirement. I explained that a bank account had the customer 's personal and private identifying information along with confidential financial information. I did not want an insurance agent to have access to this information, and I had a right to privacy. The supervisor reiterated to the service rep that unless I allowed the local State Farm insurance agent 's name to be placed on my account as my contact for the account, State Farm Bank would have to refuse to open the bank account for me.  The service rep promised that he would add the words  no soliciting '' to my record. I told him that this was not acceptable, that I did not want the names of any local insurance agents listed on my bank account records. The State Farm Bank service rep refused to open an IRA account at the bank without my being assigned a local State Farm insurance agent by the bank to be listed on my bank account records. I was told repeatedly that I would not be allowed to open an account at the bank. I did not agree to have a local State Farm insurance agent assigned to my IRA bank account, so I was rejected as a customer - not allowed to open a bank account -- solely for this reason.

6752,"HSBC froze funds and closed checking and credit card accounts without giving reason and without allowing the opportunity for any defense.  We suspect the only reason is that the account holder is a XXXX national.  The account holder is a retired XXXX window who lives in XXXX. The checking account has been open for more than 10 years and the activity on the account has not changed since. The source of the funds have also remained unchanged, the account is funded with regular check deposits from passive rental income. The real property which is the source of the income is located within the US and has been owned by the account holder for 40 years, and it was purchased when the account holder was a permanent US resident, with income generated from employment in the US.  The problems started when suspicious calls were made by someone who purported to be from HSBC to the account holder 's residence in XXXX, so we inquired by sending an online banking  bank mail '' message and HSBC responded that there were no records of HSBC having made calls, so we assumed they were fraudulent calls. Later we received a letter sent to the US mailing address, stating that we needed to call a number to provide missing information before a certain date. No mention of what information was being requested was provided. We made the call in a timely manner but were told by HSBC that we had to provide the unspecified information in person, at a specific HSBC branch, ( which was not near our US address nor was it the branch where the account was opened ). The deadline was not extended regardless that we explained that the account holder resided abroad. The funds were frozen and online banking access blocked. The account holder was able to fly to the US and go the indicated HSBC branch a couple days after the deadline. She brought with us passports, bank statements and proof of the source of the income. We were told by a XXXX XXXX, a Bank manager at the HSBC Branch on XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX, NY, that  they '' may not accept the information and documents we were showing her. But she would not tell us who  they '' were or precisely what information was required. All we knew is that because the account was from a XXXX national,  they '' needed the source of funds information. We were, however, able to draw an HSBC cashiers check with most of the funds, and decided to take out business elsewhere. We were also told that we could continue using an HSBC credit card which they said had nothing to do with the checking account. Today, notwithstanding, we received a letter informing us that the credit account was being closed because we allegedly failed to provide the information they requested, and online banking is blocked so we can not even pay the balance on the account and will likely incur interests for late payment.  We vehemently deny having failed to provide information. We, in fact, provided information regardless of never having been clearly told what information was required or why it was being requested. The only thing we were told was that banking has changed now a days. I understand that HSBC has been involved in international money laundering. But we are not criminals, all funds are traceable to a legitimate source. Unfortunately, it appears that simply for being XXXX, lawful funds were withheld, credit ratings may be harmed, and the accounts were closed. All, for no good reason. The fear of loosing the funds she depends on have caused significant troubles and distress to the innocent account holder, who happens to be my mother and I am a US Citizen. I am also an NY XXXX and am able to understand how regulations work, so I can confidently say that HSBC appears to be acting unfairly and, perhaps, unlawfully.

We can also show faxes, witnesses, police reports, emails, phone records right on down the line and the fact we never were once late with a credit card bill, ever, we always paid more than was expected.

From XXXX XXXX through XXXX XXXX, First Niagara Bank charged my company over {$3700.00} in analysis service charges.

These fees are predatory in nature and a tactic used by First Niagara to make the former XXXX banks more profitable and justify their acquisition costs ; these fees created additional financial surplus at the expense of the customer. Further, customers were not given sufficient time to find a new bank or given the opportunity to move their business with a notice of the new fees.   I have made several attempts to address this issue with my local branch, but was told that they could not help me. I have also contacted First Niagara Bank and met with a regional representative.

The promotional code that I used for the {$250.00} checking bonus was n't expired until XXXX XXXX which was after when my account was established. This code was confirmed originally by the phone agent, and the bank should have kept the recording of this phone call as proof of my claim. Moreover, I also have email proof of this promotion sent by the bank so there is no denying from the bank for refusing to honor it. The worst thing was with their customer service which seemed to have mostly been trained to tell all customers that the promotion was not from the bank at all, and the bank website has been hacked or at least the promotion page was hacked to send out this bonus. I have NEVER heard such a ridiculous response from any other financial institutions before, and it is seriously shocking to learn that a good sized bank like BMO Harris could NOT honor its bonus for whatever reason.  The second issue is with the XXXX monthly fees charged. I have to say that their banking system is the worst I have ever dealt with, even credit unions are having better systems to make the process easy to use and streamlined for their customers. When I created my online banking account I expect everything to be automated and did NOT have to call customer service to get it to work. This has been my experience with any other financial institutions that I 've dealt with, however BMO Harris system is different and does n't work without manual intervention. The request for refunds is for the amount of time and trouble it caused me to set it up successfully. If I received the initial temporary password that your website was supposedly to send out, I would have completed the enrollment process in no time and transferred in enough funds to waive the monthly fees.  So to summarize, I 'd appreciate CFPB to work on my behalf with the bank in order for them to honor my bonus, and refund the fees charged inappropriately. Thank you very much. ",dai77@purdue.edu,1

In XXXX 2016 we received another letter from Wells Fargo Merchant Services stating the card holder insisting he he is not satisfied with the service and claiming he has contacted XXXX and he was denied service or refund without any specifics. Once again XXXX responded with another letter to Merchant Services that neither XXXX repair center nor the XXXX toll free Customer Service has any record of the alleged customer ever contacting us to report any claim or dispute of any kind. We requested the XXXX XXXX to have the card holder contact us for followup. We have tried to contact the card holder via the contact information he had provided on his invoice in XXXX and have left voice mail with no reply. Wells Fargo Merchant Service returned the charge back to the card holder favoring card holder 's claim of contacting XXXX and refusal of XXXX to provid service or refund. We have requested Wells Fargo to provide us with any specifics, information dates time etc and they have not been able to. Rules and regulations in Charge Back Management Guideline for Visa Merchant Section XXXX : XXXX XXXX, states :  The cardholder claims that the terms of the sale were misrepresented by the merchant for this reason, the cardholder must have made a valid attempt to resolve the dispute or return the merchandise.Based on information provided and the card holder 's attempts to avoid having contact with XXXX, and XXXX 's inability to reach the cardholder via contact information he had provided thus preventing XXXX to have any opportunity to examine and substantiate any claim, we believe this is a classic case of what is referred to as Friendly Fraud. Fraud is one of the most common methods cardholders use to file a chargeback. Chargeback fraud occurs when a customer files a chargeback on a legitimate transaction instead of following the merchant 's procedures for requesting a refund. Well-intentioned customers may accidentally commit chargeback fraud because they are ignorant of the differences between a traditional refund and a bank-issued refund. They do n't know what chargeback fraud is and incorrectly assume a chargeback is simply an easier way to get their money back.Other consumers are aware of the loopholes in the chargeback process and knowingly abuse this consumer protection mechanism. For example, a customer will authorize a credit card transaction and later file a fraudulent chargeback once the item has been received. In this case, chargeback fraud is committed in the hopes of getting something for free. We believe the Wells Fargo Bank Merchant Services is in direct violation of Visa Chargeback Management Guide Section XXXX : Chargeback Reason Codes XXXX Merchant Services has failed to investigate the dispute to verify if the card holder 's claims of contacting XXXX and XXXX refusal is true. As a result XXXX has been defrauded. Please investigate and advise. Thank you XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXXXXXXXXXX ",ahbruns@purdue.edu,0

Confirmed with Citi representatives via Live Chat and Secured Message on XXXX/XXXX/16 that I have completed all the requirements and was eligible for the bonus points during XX/XX/XXXX and had to wait 90 days ( starting from the following month ) for the points to be posted onto my XXXX XXXX account. I should have received the bonus points by XXXX/XXXX/16.   There is a $ 30 monthly fee for keeping the account open. I kept the account open solely for waiting for my XXXX XXXX miles to post but they did not show up long after the 90 day mark. Contacted Citi soon after to ask when I will get the points and they said that I was not eligible for the bonus points. They did not even send me a notice saying when or how I was disqualified while I just kept waiting and paying the $ XXXX monthly fees for a total of {$90.00} to date.   This is very misleading of Citi to first confirm then to disqualify after having paid monthly fees to keep my account open. ,dai77@purdue.edu,1

Bank of America has refused to reverse these charges, although it is not legal or certainly not in compliance with the regulations set forth by Dodd-Frank.

Also, if XXXX is skirting the regulation what interest does Bank of America have in protecting the consumer when it can freely charge customers overdraft fees because a third-party has deemed the transaction as  reoccurring '' although the transactions are different amounts and at different points within a given time period?

6956,"I bank with Bank of America. I was a victim of check scam on XXXX/XXXX/2016.  The incident : I was selling clothes online on XXXX and asked for only {$200.00} for them. A person responded to my ad and agreed to the amount and we discussed logistics of paying and sending the clothes. They sent me a check for {$1000.00} and I verified with her to make sure she did n't mean to send me this amount. She wanted me to deduct the {$200.00} from the amount and forward the remainder cash ( {$810.00} ) via money order at XXXX XXXX to a name and address. On XXXX/XXXX/2016, I received the check and deposited it in the ATM. I was going to withdraw the {$810.00} to forward it in a money order. I was given access to the whole amount of funds that same day ; it was as if the check did n't go through a screening and clearing process which Bank of America is in a better position to tell if a check is fraudulent rather than myself. The other times I 've deposited checks to my account, I 've never had access to the whole amount until the check was cleared the next day. I forwarded the remainder of the money as a money order on XXXX/XXXX/2016, however, it will show up in my bank statement as XXXX/XXXX/2016. I checked my account balance that following week and the check returned and made my account go into the negative amount. I wanted to submit a claim to dispute Bank of America 's responsibilities in this process and my responsibilities and I understand that I am likely to have to pay back the amount, however, I received poor customer service management in the month of XXXX and recently which I will explain below.  The situation : I called to submit a claim which I was finally able to submit XXXX on XXXX/XXXX/2016. This was also AFTER a week of the incident occurring and being transferred from initially the check fraud dept, ATM fraud dept, and then back to the check fraud dept after explaining to the representatives multiple times of what occurred. Therefore, I submitted a claim in the check fraud dept. I called to follow up since nobody called me back. The representative helping me that day told me that they never gave me call back because it was n't a check fraud issue and I was responsible for the amount to be paid back. The call ended because I do n't agree with how I was treated in this process. I revisited the issue and called BoA again on XXXX/XXXX/2016 because up to this point I was emotionally exhausted and I still believe the bank should 've protected me in this process. I called on XXXX and was on the phone from XXXX and had to deal with representatives not being able to find my claim number. I found out that my claim number in the check fraud dept was dismissed and it had to be referred to the ATM fraud dept but the representative I talked to did not tell me that and that I needed to submit a new claim in the appropriate department. I was referred to the ATM fraud dept to submit a new claim. He told me I could n't because the check was already returned before a claim could 've been submitted in a timely manner and that my account is forced to close by XXXX/XXXX/2016. I argued with him and said nobody told me my account is forced to close by that day since the whole month of XXXX was wasted on my case being mishandled between different departments and insufficient information or different answers. Had I known my account was forced to close as soon as my account turned negative, I would 've called earlier to setup a payment plan to recover my account to a positive amount. As for a new claim being submitted, I did n't meet the timeframe for the claim to be submitted in time because my claim was in the wrong dept the whole time after being transferred between depts many times.

He asked for my debit card, which I provided him. I then entered my security PIN on the WF Point of Sale terminal.   I opened a check ( {$220.00} ) that I had received from the United States Postal Service in front of him. He took the check, and I asked if I could receive a color copy. He said he could n't do a color copy, and instead asked if I wanted a B  W copy, to which I had declined.   He then proceeded to deposit the {$100.00} cash and asked if there was anything else I needed. I said no, and then the WF Point-of-Sale machine asked how I would like my receipt. I selected to have the receipt delivered electronically to my WF account inbox.   I had then remembered I needed to exchange some coins I brought from home. I mentioned this to him, and he seemed glad to help. He and I counted the coins together ( he used a plastic counting device ). The change amounted to a little more than {$10.00}, and he handed me a {$10.00} bill in addition to returning me some coins.   I thanked him, asking if there was anything else I needed to do. He responded in the negative, and I promptly left, going to the XXXX Bank next to the WF location.   On Friday, XXXX XXXX 2016, I had viewed my account online, and saw that it was about {$300.00} short of what it should be. Some further research led me to find that neither the check I deposited, nor the cash I deposited, had been registered in my account. I called the same WF branch and spoke to the branch manager. The branch manager confirmed that there was no check that had been deposited in my account in the time period I gave her ( XXXX - XXXX XXXX ). She then asked me several times if I was sure I 'd gone to that exact WF, to which I replied in the affirmative. She told me that the chances that I did n't go to this WF branch were greater than the chances of XXXX of her employees just taking the cash. She advised me to find the check number from the USPS, and call back.   Around XXXX, I 'd called the same WF branch, and asked to speak with the manager. I was transferred to the Assistant Manager, as the Manager had left for the day. Upon giving the Assistant Manager my check number, he affirmed that no such check had been deposited. He said I could stop payment on the check, but gave me no option for retrieving / finding my cash. He said it was unlikely that I was at that WF branch. I 'd requested to see the video tape to prove that I 'd been there, to which he refused, saying that I 'd need to file a Police Report to have access to the tape. I 'd asked him if there was any other way I could view the tape, to which he said, he 'd given me all my options, and hung up abruptly. ",mxuan@purdue.edu,0

They claimed I listed all XXXX accounts belonging to in brother. The only information I had were the last XXXX numbers of his checking and Money market accounts.  They also claimed the letter stated I was claiming reimbursements for XXXX checks. The reason I am certain I did not write such a letter was because a banker, employed by Bank America at a NC branch, called the Check Fraud Claims Dept for me because no one responded to my request and my emails and phone calls wee ignored. We did not ask for payment on utility checks that forged because they had become my responsibility. XXXX of the XXXX checks I was reinbursed for they went back into his closed account. Long story short my account got so screwed up, I would have to hire an accountant to determine if the balance was accurate.  I also am challenging the letter they enclosed was ever written or mailed to me. When someone suggest they withheld monies because they believed I was forgoing the checks.  That is one letter you would not forget receiving. Do n't have time to point out other errors made by it 's author.  Since they failed to send a copy of my handwriting so you could see my handwriting does n't come close to the checks they claimed I forged.  Please notice their final response as to why they could not provide me copies of the banking records was because listed in their customer agreement booklet it states that they must retain a clients records for at least 5 years. I did not see where it states copies were not privy to Executor 's and that their banking regulations supersedes the Laws that are on record that they are required to uphold.

7018,"In XXXX 2016 I opened a Citi ThankYou Premiere Credit Card. In XXXX 2016 I did research into other Citi products and account options and came across an online offer for XXXX ThankYou points for new customers that opened a Citi Gold Checking account. I decided that the bonus incentive was worth opening a new account and proceeded to do so using the online promotion code. I activated my account and received physical mail which I responded to to complete the new account process.   The requirements of receiving the new customer incentive offer was to use their eBill payment service for a period of 3 months after opening a new account - a requirement that I knew I could meet ( and did ).   A month after opening the checking account I called and spoke to a Citi Gold account representative to confirm that I was following all steps required to receive the promotion - I was assured I was doing everything as expected as per my promotion contract. I explicitly asked if after fulfilling my obligations that were part of the contract I would be eligible for the XXXX ThankYou points - his answer was  yes ''.   In XXXX ( 3 months after opening the account ) I called again to the Citi account reps. I went over the details of my promotion and the representative said that ALL THE REQUIREMENTS WERE MET and that the points should post to the account in 1-3 months.   In XXXX ( 5 months after opening the account ) I called to check the status of my promotional points. The representative that I spoke to was as confused as I was to why the points had not yet posted and opened a support ticket inquiry into the matter that would escalate the issue to their back offices. I waited a few days and then called back to find out the status of the inquiry. It was then that I was learned of their deceptive business practice.   The representative on the phone ( and later his supervisor when I asked to speak with her ) both told me that I was not part of their internal list of candidates for the promotion. Supposedly Citi mails/eMails out promotion codes only to certain prospective new customers and I was not on their internal list. This did not stop them from accepting my application with the referral code, taking my money, having their representatives confirm verbally my eligibility or charging me monthly account maintenance fees ( {$30.00} per month ) - all in an attempt to bait me into using their service with a non-existing reward at the end of the process.   I feel cheated by CitI Gold checking for taking my money in monthly fees ( {$30.00} per month ) only to deny me the sign up bonus that would have covered about a years worth of monthly fees. If I was not on their secret list of qualified customers, this should have been communicated MONTHS before wasting both time and money in a non-existing promotion. Why was I not confirmed or denied as soon as I signed up for a new account? Why were the representatives that I spoke to multiple times not made aware that I was not on their list for the documented bonus? Why should I have the responsibility of fulfilling the obligations of the promotion ( which I did withing the expected 3 month period ) and Citi not have the responsibility of rewarding that good behavior? Why should I comply with the terms on the contract only to have the same contract broken by Citi because I was later found not to be on their secret internal list of  qualified new customers ''?!   The only resolution I seek is for Citi to honor their promotional incentive and give me the XXXX ThankYou points as were promised. By denying me the contracted benefit this amounts to a deceptive business practice and feels like a bait and switch to get new customers without reciprocating any goodwill bonus.  I await your resolution. ",mxuan@purdue.edu,1
7022,"I reached out to multiple parties at PNC Bank for 2 issues without any success : 1. {$300.00} new account bonus ( get a different story every time ) 2. Excessive overdraft charges that I can not get any recent response to.  The following is more information : {$300.00} Bonus I opened a Virtual Wallet Performance Select Checking account with a savings account via a banner ad in XXXX of 2012. The banner ad specified requirements and I met all the requirements. I have been following up for over 4 years now and I get different answers everywhere I go. In 2012, the branch told me to call the XXXX number. They told me that I opened the account in a branch ( XXXX I never visited ) and thus was not eligible. I went back to a branch and was told that sometimes they assign online accounts to branches. I called the XXXX number again and they said there was nothing they could do. I go back to branch and escalate and they have someone from XXXX give me a call. They leave a name and number and no-one returns my call. Finally, I find someone and they say that it 's too old. I find a VP and he forwards it along and another person tells me that they ca n't find any promotion at that time. They ask for proof that there was a promotion ... how am I supposed to do that after all this time?   Now what is really infuriating ... I never got anyone to respond to this inquiry : overdraft fees that have been applied to my account since opening. I have been charged over {$2000.00} in overdraft fees.   I think what is most frustrating about the overdraft fees is that PNC has overdraft protection ( that I was never told about until my last conversation a month ago with a rep ). I have called dozens of times and made visits to try and understand the fees and how they relate to Bill Pay, CheckCard purchases, and of course the deposits I make to cover the transactions. While I do n't claim to be the best money manager, I have always moved money to PNC to cover such charges. Also, I 'm confused by the consistency of the messages I get ... in some cases I have the fees refunded, in other situations ( which are the same ) I do n't. I get the line from PNC reps that they can only offer a courtesy refund on charges once a year. But then as I go through my statements, some were refunded well within a year of each other. Also, it seems like I get charged multiple fees on the same day for the same overdraft. ",flanagak@purdue.edu,0
7024,"XX/XX/XXXX First National Bank acquired XXXX branch offices from XXXX XXXX. As a result of this transaction both our checking account and savings account were automatically transferred to First National Bank on XXXX XXXX. Our mortgage remained with XXXX.  The XXXX XXXX Bank accounts were established ( XX/XX/XXXX ) as a contingency for receiving a mortgage. One requirement being to have the mortgage payment paid directly from the checking account. The only requirement on the savings account was to maintain a minimum of {$25.00} and all fees were waived.  At no time were we notified by either bank that this arrangement would change. In fact the mortgage was still automatically being deducted from the new First National checking account.  On XXXX XXXX we visited our local First National branch to withdraw our balances and to close our accounts. The checking account balance was what we expected but the savings account showed a balance of {$1.00}. I questioned this figure and the teller pulled up the account on her computer screen and explained that the reduced balance was the result of fees and finance charge for the account being inactive. I expressed my displeasure and the bank manager called the branch that was responsible for the account. She spoke with the assistant manager who offered to refund {$10.00} in addition to the {$1.00} balance but no more since we were closing the account.  As of XXXX XXXX we had not received a statement from First National or any communication about their policy on this savings account. As of this date, XXXX XXXX, XXXX, we have received only a notice of the account being closed. I am expecting to receive an end of quarter statement at the beginning of XXXX which I expect will agree with printout that I received from the teller on XX/XX/XXXX. It showed that the bank deducted {$10.00}  dormant account fee '' on XXXX XXXX. This is a mere 11 days after the account was transferred to First National. This was followed on XXXX XXXX with a {$4.00}  service fee '' and by another {$10.00}  dormant account fee '' on XXXX XXXX.  This whole thing over {$25.00} may sound petty but First National did the same thing to my daughter and her husband. I suspect that we are n't the only accounts that have been ripped off. This could be a substantial amount of money if they did this with every account that was transferred in the sale. ",wu467@purdue.edu,1
7026,"I opened an basic checking account with Regions back in XX/XX/XXXX/XX/XX/XXXX. At that time I was advised to opt-in to the overdraft protection. Based on the explanation, it sounded like a good feature.   Sometime in XX/XX/XXXX, I experienced my first overdraft but it did n't make sense to me. I called in and the agent I spoke with could n't adequately explain the logic behind why I was charged. The way the information was listed on my account online suggested that I had enough funds in my account and that the overdraft fee is what overdrafted my account! At that time, they refunded an overdraft fee and helped me opt-out of the feature.   As it was explained to me, opting-out of their overdraft protection would PREVENT any overdraft scenarios from happening. This is clearly not the case.   Fast forward to recently, I made a debit card purchase online on XX/XX/XXXX and that purchase did not  clear '' until yesterday. Every single day I 've been checking my available balance and every single day it showed this {$39.00} had already been subtracted from my balance. But now when I check today, it just posted and caused me an overdraft.   Additionally, on several occasions they have been unable to explain the order of transactions.

7027,"I currently have an open claim with Bank of America due to an incident of fraud on my checking account with them. I had noticed a charge in the nominal amount of {$77.00} from a company name I did not recognize. After querying the payment, I was informed that the same amount had been taken since XXXX/XXXX/XXXX. It was agreed that this was fraud and the money was refunded to the account on XXXX/XXXX/XXXX a day after the claim was initiated. On XXXX/XXXX/XXXX Bank of America decided that the charges did in fact stand and that we had made them so proceeded to take the entire sum of the charges totaling {$850.00} from my checking account. They did however credit XXXX amount of {$77.00} back to us on XXXX/XXXX/XXXX of those taken. This implies that XXXX is fraud but the other charges are not and presents yet another inconsistency in Bank of America 's claims procedure. Since then, the claim has become a full time job to fight. My wife and I have spent endless hours on the phone to the claims department, as well as having to go in branch. After demanding the paperwork and evidence Bank of America were basing their actions on, we received copies of agreements made with XXXX XXXX for items of furniture using our details. The details given were incredibly basic, with just my name, routing and account numbers being listed. Bank of America refuse to budge based on our routing number being present but these are readily available for hackers, fraudsters or mail thieves and as such, consumers rely on their banks to provide the safety they promise. However, Bank of America failed to provide this at even the most basic level in this instance. We were told by the claims department that the charges stood in part due to my signature being on the documents but it was not my signature. It was a printed version of my name, perhaps even done via an online form and nothing remotely close to my handwriting or signature. The agreements also did not contain my phone number or any other details customary to a finance application. There were so many red flags with this transaction that the principal ruling allowed for a refund of the money taken but the decision was bizarrely reversed by even more questionable evidence. So far, in addition to the aforementioned actions taken by Bank of America, there has been a consistent lack of adequate customer service and the claims department has been evasive at best. My wife has gone to the branch several times in the past week to demand help, usually to be told that nothing could be done and she should call the claims department. As both of us have spent countless hours doing just that, she has persisted in demanding help from the in branch staff. A cashier at the Bank of America in XXXX, off XXXX XXXX, told her that she could make an appointment for someone to call the claims department in branch and advocate for her. My wife was told that her  appointment '' would be the following Tuesday at XXXX and that she would have to bring all of the paperwork and documents we have. She arrived in branch at the given time but was informed that there was no appointment. The cashier who had made it with her was present but no accountability was taken beyond it being a 'misunderstanding '. After demanding to speak to a manager, one came out  eventually asked that she bring a letter refuting the charges with my signature as supporting evidence. She did so the following day and it was allegedly faxed to the claims department. After a follow up call with the claims department this morning, she was told that they had not received the fax and to check back on Monday.

This is very concerning that such a large institution as Citibank is not standing behind their marketing campaign 's, allowing consumers to open checking accounts under false pretenses/expectations.  To make matters even more frustrating a family member of mine that that lives at the same address opened the same account with the same promotional offer and has received his miles credited to his XXXX XXXX account. At no point did he receive any push back Citibank indicating he was n't eligible since the offer was targeted.  This feels like discrimination and that Citibank does n't have compliance controls in place to regulate these accounts to insure fair treatment of all customers. ",agosnell@purdue.edu,1

I have kept my most precious and valuable items in the perceived and presented safest place that I could think of. I have trusted my family precious items such as my father medals and many other rare items to the safety deposit box system.  In XXXX 2015, I went to the bank to check an item out of my box at that time, I leaned that they have moved all the safety deposit boxes to another location due to their own valid reasons. The banker told me that I should have received a letter informing me about that action, but the banker also assured me that I should not worry, since my box has been transferred to repository and untouched.  The banker advised and helped me to locate another deposit box in another branch, since they did not have XXXX available. I was told it will take three business days to get my box transferred from repository to the branch.  A week later I got a disturbing call from the bank, while I was at the hospital with my father, informing me that they can not locate my box, but I should not worry! When the bank tells you, your are safe and you should not worry, they XXXX should worry!  Prior to XXXX of XXXX weekend I contact bank to follow up on my missing box! The bank manager told me that she thinks they have located my box, but I need to go in and describe some of the unique items to validate it is my box.  I rushed to the bank and passed the quiz and they verified that I am the owner of the box that has been marked as  Owner : Unknown! '' This validated the fact that the bank had not contacted me as they claimed that they had, since my box was marked Unknown.  A week later the director of XXXX XXXX branch contacted me to inform me that they have the box. I asked if they could meet me at the other branch with security so I can check the box in to the new box.  We met at the XXXX XXXX branch and my safety deposit box has transformed to a XXXX cardboard box. The card board box had a bag full of my empty containers and all my items were in another plastic bag wrapped in disarray in individual bubble wraps.  My husband  I at presence of the Wells Fargo branch director spent two hours opening and setting items in order and back in original boxes  learned few major items missing.  The containers were missing even according to the bank inventory listing. I had the director note this discrepancy  sign.  The director advised me that may be they have been misplaced in another box and he asked me to allow him to check that out.  Later he contacted me and sent me a claim and bank complaint form, since they could not find my missing items.  I also called the police department and reported the missing items and given a case number.  After I submitted the form, the bank representative contacted me and asked me if I have insurance on my items, I said no. The next question was how the bankers have not handle things the right way and I should not have ever given the inventory list ... ..  The last contact I had with bank representative was a letter informing me that bank liability due to the bank negligence is limited to {$500.00} per item!  Then I reached out and hired an attorney, a year later, I have learned that I can not go to court, since I have agreed to arbitration, when signed the contract.  Also I have learned that arbitration that is done by a lawyer may cost up to {$100000.00} depending on the length of the process.

I am a college student and this is absolutely devastating to my financial situation. {$34.00} might not seem like a lot of money to Chase but to me it made a huge difference. When I called them they were not understanding and told me there was nothing they could do. {$34.00} is over three times as much as it was over-drafted by. ",jdenhar@purdue.edu,0
7465,"I had opened a checking and savings account with BB  T in XXXX, TX as part of a student promotion. I had submitted my personal information to the banker together with the forms required to open the account. The forms that I submitted include Account Enrollment Form, BB  T signature card form, Overdraft Decision Form. The account enrollment form was signed and given to the banker by me when she came to the university to open the account. However, the BB  T signature card form and overdraft decision form was mailed to me by the banker and I filled it, signed and sent it back by US mail around XXXX XXXX 2015. While opening the account, the banker did not provide me with any other details regarding my account. However, around XXXX XXXX 2015, there was some fraudulent activity that occur ed in my account which I came to know through overdraft notices received in the mail. I immediately notified the bank about this and they closed my account around XXXX XXXX 2015. I filed disputes with the bank regarding the fraudulent activity in my account. I filed complaints with the XXXX police department and USPS mail theft division. I submitted all these reports to BB  T to aid them in the dispute investigation process. The outcomes of the dispute I had filed with the bank was not in my favor. They rejected my dispute claim saying that the account opening process was all done according to their procedures. I was not satisfied with the response given to me and I went personally to the bank to request all the forms that I had submitted to them during the account opening process. The banker gave me a copy of the BB  T signature card form and to my shock, I noticed that the form I had submitted to the bank was different from the one they had in their system. The bank claims that my account was opened on XXXX XXXX, 2015 and they gave me a copy of the BB  T signature card form with my signature and date as XXXX XXXX, 2015. However, I did not sign and mail these forms to the bank till XXXX XXXX 2015. I came to know that the actual form I sent to the bank was not in their system and they had a different form in their system with a different date. All the dispute investigations have been based on the forms that they have in their system and not the ones I submitted. I had requested the bank to give me all the forms associated with my account as I feel that all my personal information has been misused. The forms that I had requested the bank include : 1. Account enrollment form, 2. BB  T signature card form, 3. Overdraft review decision form. The banker told me last week that she has put in a request to obtain the other forms and it will take around 2-3 business days to get these. However, this week I received a call from another banker saying that they can not give me the forms and asked me to contact their legal department to obtain them. The banker told me that she does not have access to the forms. I questioned this statement, asking how another banker whom I was talking to last week was able to put in a request to obtain the forms and now she is telling me that they do not have access to it. This banker does not have a answer to my questions. I was persistent to obtain a copy of the forms for my record and this banker refused to even talk to me. She kept saying she has nothing to talk to us and we have to leave the place. My questions to her were : 1. Why does the branch not have a copy of the forms I submitted to them to open the account? They should have a file for me in the branch and that file should contain the forms.If so, why are they not willing to give it to me? When they can give me a copy of one of the forms, why not the rest?  2. How come one banker I was dealing with last week was able to put in a request to get the forms and suddenly this week, their procedure changed and they can not provide me the forms and I have to contact the legal department to get it?

While Chase apparently automatically forwarded other autopay orders to my new bank account, somehow the autopay for my Chase credit card - and only my Chase credit card - was not forwarded, and I missed two payments.

Meanwhile, my credit score has recovered but XXXX 's mortgage division insists on a letter of explanation from Chase before they will allow me to complete my refinancing.

7575,"I 've just learned that when a person uses Capital One online Billpay they are at risk of having their money stolen by Capital One. Here 's how : When you approve an online bill payment the amount is debited from your account the moment you click  send ''. Then a check is sent to the payee. However, if 90 days pass and that check has not been cashed or deposited Capital One never returns the money to the customer / PAYER 's account and never notifies the customer. They just keep the amount of the transaction. Forever.   I 've just had this confirmed by a manager at Capital One. When I pressed him on Capital One therefore basically getting to keep my money he said  no its in limbo '' but that is not true. The amount still remains on Capital One 's books as an asset because the money has never been transfered to another financial institution as would happen when the check was deposited or cashed and the cashing or depositing institution requests the funds from Capital One. Not only is this practice fraudulent but when questioned on it Capital One counted on my ignorance of how banking works to lie to me about how they benefit from the policy.   In addition, while Capital One will never return your undistributed funds, the PAYEE only has 90 days to cash or deposit the check. You would think that after that same 90 days the funds would go back to the Customer / PAYER, but this is not the case.   Therefore, in essence, every time you send out a check with Capital One 's online billpay, an invisible 90 day timer starts, and when it 's up the PAYEE ca n't collect, the PAYER is never notified, and Capital One gets to keep the customer 's funds.   I have been informed by Capital One 's representatives that if you call and ask them to give the money back, they will, after charging you a fee. But If the PAYEE never informs you that they either did n't receive or deposit/cash the check Capital One never informs you, so you do n't even know to call and ask for your money back. Then they get to keep it. I 'm sure the combination of this policy, the lack of any notification from Capital One, and how they benefit is just a coincidence.   The basic form of this situation is : 1. I ask Capital One to perform a financial transaction for me ( Bill Pay ) 2. Capital one debits the amount of the transaction from my account.  3. The financial transaction does not complete within 90 days ( The Payee never receives or claims the funds ) 4. Capital one never notifies the customer that the transaction did not complete and never returns the funds.   How can this policy and order of events, confirmed by Capital One, be described as anything other than fraud? ",jdenhar@purdue.edu,1

7608,"On XXXX XXXX 2016, my wife requested a copy of our transactions conducted against our checking and savings accounts, in an attempt to try to figure out what sort of funds availability we had, by telephone. The representative she spoke with was helpful ; however, no mention of any fees that were to be charged for this service was ever made. In addition, while most consumers only request a few pages, resulting in {$20.00} - {$30.00}, or perhaps even a {$100.00} in charges, this request resulted in over XXXX pages being printed out, going back at least a year!  The total charges for this were as follows : Joint checking account : {$850.00} Joint savings account : {$520.00} Joint savings account : {$130.00} Daughter 's checking account : {$580.00} Total : {$2000.00} That is a TOTAL of over {$2000.00} for simple copying, printing, and shipping, with NONE of these charges ever being explained to my wife! In fact, when I called to complain, the manager of the bank refused to even consider refunding even part of these fees because they were  in the depositors ' agreement '' - a document that I last looked at sometime early this year!   This amount, is not only excessive, and exorbitant, I consider it to be literally,  highway robbery '', where the consumer is not told what fees are actually going to be charged at the time!   When I called to complain about these insane charges against our accounts, I was pushed to a  manager '' who refused to even discuss the accounts in question, refused to offer any sort of recourse or recompense, and actually was somewhat rude towards me.   This manager stated that  it 's in the depositors ' agreement '' and acted as if we should have known that these amounts were going to be charged, even though not one depositor probably looks at these documents except when they are mailed out by the bank, and even then, more than likely, 95 % of depositors probably only give it a brief once over!   Additionally, she stated that USAA, and its representatives are under absolutely no obligation to disclose fees to consumers since they are  explained in the depositors ' agreement ''.   While this might be ok for fees of under {$200.00} or {$300.00}, anything above that amount, should automatically require disclosure to the consumer, especially if these fees are going to cause an account to go into a negative balance!   With regards to accounts being charged so much that they go negative : our daughter 's checking account, was charged so much in fees, that it actually did result in negative balance, which will probably result in additional fees, and none of this was explained to my wife!   While both my wife and I have access to that account, that account belongs to our daughter, who was not privy to the charges that were being levied against her account, and this in and of itself, constitutes an illegal account access by USAA to that account to charge fees that were not theirs to charge.   When the representative on the phone does not even discuss these charges and ensure that the customer making the request is aware of these charges, or the TOTAL amount of them, charging the consumer, who has been a member, for at least the last 15 years, and to drain their accounts of almost {$2100.00} is outright theft!   These charges are completely out of line with the high quality of service I expected from USAA, and the fact that the manager was rude, and refused to even discuss what she might be able to do with regards to these charges does not speak well for USAA.

7657,I bank with PNC bank. I have a issue currently with a few transactions which caused my account to go negative and NSF charges that were imposed. What happened during this situation is as follows. I was out of town and knew there was going to be a charge go thru my account next week. I was aware of this so I was very cautious with my spending. To be extra cautious I made sure that when I made any type of charge to the account I checked the balance before hand to make sure the large charge did not come out before it should have so my account would not go negative. I have been told my the service reps at the bank that the processes were in real time so I took that to mean if there was a balance in the account that it would go in the order of the charge. THIS IS NOT WHAT HAPPENED. Although I checked before each and every charge the large charge I knew was coming ( although a week early as I was afraid of happening ) did end up going thru. Now the problem is all those charges that I double checked for a balance they did not process it the way they said it would. PNC processed the large charge first and then all the other small charges afterwards causing XXXX NSF charges. I called the bank and they once again told me that Everything processes in real time. I went back and forth with them and they ended up telling me the balance is just a tool. I was not satisfied with this and the case was elevated to a supervisor. I then received a phone call a few days later and the lady told me that things are not processed in real time. This is a stark contast to what I was told in person at the branch as swell as what the online CSR told me. She went on to tell me things are really processed when the receipts are sent to the bank for payments. Well this makes things impossible to try to fix if there was some type of error on the account. Anyway I feel like the bank was completely dishonest with me on how to try and protect myself against charges. If I would have know in the first place I would have just pulled out cash out of my account and paid with things that way so I did not have several hundred dollars in NSF charges. ,cthieme@purdue.edu,1

7660,"I want to file a complaint against Bank of America. I was a victim of fraud and the bank helped the thieves. An acquaintance of mine posted on XXXX a link about a secret shopper job. So I applied and was hired.  They sent me by mail the first assignment and a check with the funds to do it. I had doubts about such an easy job, but I thought that if the check was valid it would be safe. So on XXXX/XXXX/16 I deposited a check for {$1800.00} into my bank account, and waited for the money to be available. After the bank showed the money in my account I asumed the check was clear, and it was safe to use the money for the job, so I withdrawaled it and used the money.  On XXXX/XXXX/16 I deposited a XXXX check from the same job, and when I did so the balance of my account was off.  After checking all the transactions from my account I noticed that on XXXX/XXXX/16 there was a transaction of return item for the {$1800.00}, the bank took back the money without any notice. I called them and found out that the check was n't valid. I asked them why did they acredited the money if it was n't valid and they said that they trusted me with handing them a valid check.  This is not a matter of trusting their clients, it is their job and responsability to clear the checks before putting the money into people 's accounts making them believe that their checks are valid, and they could use the money.  I withdrawaled {$1600.00} to do the assignment, because I believed that if the money was already in my account that meaned it was real and I had a job to perform as secret shopper.  Bank of America failed in doing their job, which is protecting their customer 's money, and now after they realized that the check that I deposited was n't valid they just removed the money from my account, and told me it is my responsability to verify the checks. I thought I did that by depositing the check and waiting for them to validate it.  Bank of America is helping the thieves steal their clients money, because they make their clients believed that they 've cleared the checks, when they have n't and the robbers must know this. I would n't have fallen in the scam if the bank had n't put the money in my account making me believe that it was all right to use it.  They never let me know that I had to wait for a period of time to use the money in my account, after I deposited a check and they complete the transaction by showing the money in my balance.  With this complaint I ask Bank of America to reinburse the amount of {$1800.00} to my account, as well as the return check fee. Also the bank needs to stop paying checks into an account without verifying it beforehand. ",mxuan@purdue.edu,0

The notion that you have to present ID to make a {$30.00} credit card payment with cash is preposterous. Chase is making up rules and that are beyond the scope of any banking regulations.

7666,"Dear CPFB, At this point I feel as though I have no other choice than to involve a third party in order to get Citibank to cooperate with me and listen to my valid complaints. First and foremost, I have what was supposed to be a free checking account that I 've held for almost fifteen years without incident, but now almost never use. There appears to be many fees from Citibank attached to this so-called free checking account that I do not understand. Furthermore, when the account for some reason despite almost never being used became overdrawn, perhaps in part due to these mystery fees from Citibank, Citibank did NOT notify me. Instead, they allowed my overdraft account to become totally exhausted, in order to charge me additional interest and fees on the account, that much is clear, but rather than call me when this occurred, they sent me a letter which looked like an ordinary statement rather than call me. Citibank has claimed in said letter that they no longer have my contact information, even though none of it has changed in over ten years. This is either false on the part of Citibank, or it shows extreme incompetence in terms of their record keeping.   The most egregious part, is that even though I sent a certified letter to my branch begging them to please call me to answer my questions, they have ignored my request and instead reported my as DELINQUENT to the major credit bureaus. Without one phone call, and I have banked there for almost 15 years! I have very good credit, pay my bills on time, and have never been delinquent on a payment in my life, yet Citibank who I believe has a lot of explaining to do to ME in terms of this account has RUINED my hard earned credit.   This should not be allowed to happen. They should be investigated and they should provide me with the answers I am seeking. I can only wonder how many others may be getting treated like this by a major financial institution who seems to think they have no accountability whatsoever to their customers.

7668,"Dear Sir/ Madam, I am writing to you today about an issue I had with Citibank ; and more specifically, a Citigold checking account that I have opened with them XX/XX/XXXX. At the time of opening the account, I have used a promotion that should have awarded me XXXX XXXX XXXX miles after meeting certain requirements. After opening the account, I have confirmed with Citibank customer service in writing that my account was successfully enrolled in the promotion and that I am eligible for it. The following is an excerpt from the answer I received on XXXX/XXXX/XXXX :  Thank you for choosing Citibank for your financial needs. I can confirm that you opened your account with the promotion XXXX for XXXX AA miles. '' On the next day, I have had another interaction with Citibank and provided them with my mileage account number. Again, I have received an answer that implicitly confirms that they see I am enrolled and eligible in the promotion. They have even cited the requirements that I need to meet in order for the miles to be deposited in my mileage account. The following is a part of the message I did receive :  I will be more than happy to assist you with the XXXX AA miles promotion for checking account ending in XXXX. Thank you for providing your AA account number. Our records show promotion code XXXX is applied to your checking account. Listed below are the requirements you must complete to qualify for the offer : Open a new Regular Checking account in the Citigold Account Package by XXXX/XXXX/XXXX. Within 60 days after account opening : complete Qualifying Debit Card Purchases of {$1000.00} using the Citibank Debit Card which must be posted to the new checking account. And 1 qualifying bill payment must be posted to the new checking account each month for XXXX consecutive calendar months. The AAdvantage bonus miles will be credited by Citibank to your AAdvantage account within 90 days from the end of the statement period in which you complete all offer requirements. .  Not only did they confirm the requirements but they also confirmed the deadline for the miles to be deposited which is fine so far as it is consistent with the timeframe they provided when I opened the account. On XXXX/XXXX/XXXX, I have confirmed with the bank that the requirements were met and this was their answer :  After reviewing your account, I see that you completed the requirements, and were met on the statement cycle that ended on XXXX/XXXX/XXXX, please allow up to 90 days for the bonus miles to be credited. '' After more than 90 days noticing that the bonus was not posted to my account I reached again to them and they told me :  After reviewing your account, I can confirm you completed the requirements, please note the bonus miles are processed by the end of the statement cycle of XX/XX/XXXX, please allow up to XXXX weeks for processing, if you have not received the bonus miles by XXXX XXXX you may reach out to us by phone or send another message and we will gladly open a case for further research.

Subsequently, I am submitting this formal complaint because I judge that Citibank has been very misleading to me in this transaction. If I am not eligible as they claim ; then they should have told me so from the very beginning and I would have understood it. However, they confirmed to me the eligibility and that everything is fine and that I should not worry again and again and again while deducting the XXXX $ monthly fee that the account carries every month.

7691,"On XXXX XXXX, I closed my account because of some issues, and because I was in the process of withdrawing my authorization from some internet lenders, who I was told were void in my state. The XXXX dollars that were in the account were transferred to a new account, and the old account was closed. I alerted all of the other entities that I wanted to continue to have access to my account, the new account number. I did not include the lenders, because they are void, and because I was withdrawing their authorization. I did not give them permission to the new account. At that time, the gentleman, XXXX XXXX, who helped me close the account and transfer the small amount of money in it said that anything outstanding that had been authorized to debit from the account within 24 hours of closing would be taken out, but that after that, the account would be closed for good. No attempt by any entity to debit my account occurred during that timeframe, so I was under the impression that the account was completely closed. I was getting help crafting the authorization withdrawal from the internet lenders since last week. When I looked at my email today, I had an email from SunTrust saying that there was an error on the  closed '' account, and that I had an overdraft, and that I needed to take care of it as soon as possible. It went on to say that my balance on the  closed '' account was negative as of XXXX/XXXX/16, and that I had to bring it to a positive status within five business days.  I was shocked to see that the  closed '' account, was re-opened to pay the lenders I did not want to continue to do business with. I called the bank, and went in to speak with XXXX XXXX at XXXX today. I asked why there was an overdraft on a closed account. He said to me that I had given the lenders authorization, and that because of that Suntrust has the right to open up a closed account to allow what used to be a regular debit from that account, even a week after the account had been closed.  I was shocked an a appalled that my bank could re-open a closed account to cover an entity I was trying to cut ties with. Verbal authorizations do n't seem to work, so I am now doing written authorization withdrawals, because I can not trust my bank to actually close my account and leave it closed. Also because they re-opened a closed account, lenders will be able to debit again and again, putting my account further in the negative! I am disgusted and disappointed at Suntrust, that they can decide that if I gave authorization, they get to decide how and when I pay the lenders and not me. I closed my account as a first step in the process to disengage from the illegal lenders, and SunTrust is trying to profit. They are playing the role of the decider, instead of me, the consumer. I never thought that a closed account can be re-opened by the discretion of the bank, even though I never asked them to. I gave my new account information to the entities that I wanted to continue to do business with. I now  owe '' Suntrust for a service I never asked them for. I think they are doing this to padd their pockets.

7710,"On two occasions, Wells Fargo intentionally ignored a wire transfer amendment from my issuing bank to my Wells Fargo ( XXXX XXXX, MN ) checking account, countered that they can not amend the wire transfer because they do not have the funds, but actually had the funds and withheld those funds from our checking account for two weeks, and then resent the funds back to the issuing bank minus a {$25.00} fee. Subsequently, I had to rewire those funds to my Wells Fargo account, and pay a whole new set of fees.   This Wells Fargo scam of ignoring wire transfer amendments and blatantly lying about holding funds, all just to overcharge clients with multiple fees is just plain wrong. I have documented proof that Wells Fargo lied about the funds whereabouts and were withholding funds, all in an effort to avoid a simple wire transfer amendment, in order to steal from me ( either by ripping me off on fees, or possibly taking the whole {$1500.00} if I never insistently claimed to get the money back ). Shame on them.   I tried to be reasonable, and only seek reimbursement for the fees charged after the blocking of the wire amendment/withholding of the funds. I did not seek damages for initial wire transfer fees, my time and frustrated efforts, or for the harm my son suffered for only having {$120.00} to live on for two weeks while Wells Fargo was withholding our funds. These fees in which I sought reimbursement were as follows : 1 ) XXXX XXXX : Wells Fargo {$25.00} wire fee for returning funds, Wells Fargo {$16.00} wiring fee for receiving same funds again, XXXX {$30.00} wiring fee for issuing funds again 2 ) XXXX XXXX : Wells Fargo {$25.00} wire fee for returning funds, Wells Fargo {$16.00} wiring fee for receiving same funds again, XXXX {$30.00} wiring fee for issuing funds again.

7930,"I had a bank account with US Bank for over 3 years while I worked for them. Shortly after I changed to another company, the account began charging a {$17.00} monthly service fee. I was n't sent notice that this would change, and as a result I decided that I was going to close the account. I began the process of changing over all my direct deductions so that I could close the account without any issues. I had one last medical account that had n't changed over, but also had n't been paid because I had no balance. Before I closed the checking account, I had visited the dentist and accumulated a balance on that medical card account, so the autopay resumed from the US Bank account. This caused an overdraft that I was unaware of because I was no longer using the account. Once I logged in to transfer my final few dollars to my new account I found that my medical card autopay had caused a negative balance of just over {$34.00}. When I was finally able to get into a physical branch to pay and close the account, the balance had increased. More monthly fees and extended overdraft had been added. To that point, I had still received no mail to alert me to the problem. I paid the teller at the branch {$35.00} and requested that the account be closed and the balance waived because the balance that remained was all bank fees. In more than 3 years I did n't have a single fee waived, yet the teller advised that this request could only be completed at the branch that the account was opened through. I explained that I had moved and it would be difficult to get back to the original branch, however she was still not able to assist me. Shortly after this, and before I got back to the state with my original branch, the account was sent to a collection team. As soon as I received a letter from them I placed a call explaining that the balance was all fees, and I requested that it be waived. I was again advised that only the originating branch could assist with waiving fees. I called t down to the branch that the account was opened in and explained that it was difficult to come down in person, but that this was the only branch that could resolve my problem. They referred me to the manager of that branch who said he also could not help because the account was placed in collection, and once that happens it is out of his hands. He stated that he would look into the issue and call me back in a couple days, it has been over a month, and I have n't heard from him again. I now have an account that could at some point be listed on my credit report as a collection, it is a balance of all bank fees, and no one will assist me. This checking account pulled {$25.00} from a savings account that had no funds to pay down the increasing bank fees, and that savings account had also been closed and charged off.

Not to mention, she stated that ATM fees should have been waived too. She quickly transferred me to the Military Department. The new representative agreed that the Military accounts have specific benefits which civilian accounts do n't share. But, unlike the first representative he refused to tell me what those benefits might be. Instead, he asked me to wait a few days, while they reviewed the account to determine which benefits they will approve for me. I was appalled, as the benefits should be what they are, despite the current status of my account. I felt as though they wanted to review what their liability was and then pick and choose what they will reimburse me for. I asked that he explain the benefits and he continued to refuse.

After I met all the terms and conditions to obtain the benefits of this offer the incentive was not credited to my account.  I allowed Citibank a little over 2 months time but no results.  Thus I made the first inquiry regarding this promotion on XXXX ( see Attachment-2 ) and the customer representative indeed confirmed that I met the requirements for the promotion and confirmed that the bonus incentive will be credited to me that very same week.

After that, I made multiple inquiries via telephone to follow_up and every time I kept getting told that I will be paid the promotional incentive that week/that month/ etc.   Please keep in mind that there is also a relatively high monthly service fee associated with the Citigold account and Citibank has been charging me this monthly fee but not yet giving me the Promotional incentive.   I must reaffirm that the Citigold checking account offer 's terms and conditions were all clearly listed in the promotional flyer and I have ensured to meet all these terms within the stipulated timelines in order to obtain the benefits of this offer.  I should qualify for this promotion based on the following two reasons : First I respond to a promotion regarding a new Citigold account offer ; apply for it ; get approved by the new account servicing team and I retain/keep a physical printout of the offer disclosures ( see Attachment 1 ) which serves as a proof of eligibility.  Second I entered the promotional code from the promotional flyer when applying for my Citigold checking account.  My account was approved and the Citigold new account servicing team informed me ( during the account activation process ) that I will receive the Promotional incentive after I meet the terms during the account reviewing/activation process.  Furthermore the customer representative has confirmed that I met the requirements for the promotion when I made the first inquiry regarding this promotion on XXXX ( see Attachment 2 ).  Citibank should not take advantage of this misleading marketing advertisement to lure customers to open new accounts.  Please keep in mind that there is also a relatively high monthly service fee associated with the Citigold account and it would take several months for new account holders to meet all the terms and conditions to obtain the promotional offer.  It is not justifiable and should be considered fraudulent for Citibank to attract new customers using this false advertisement and collect high monthly service fee from new account holders and not honor the promotional credit after customers opened their Citigold checking accounts and met all the promotion requirements and paid the monthly service fee accordingly.

Four days later my checkcard is declined and I am told by my bank that their loss prevention department suspected the check was counterfit. The check had already cleared my mom 's account. My payroll had also just deposited and it was enough to cover the check XXXX3 times over. I had no cash and they refused to release any funds.

That was sent to them on Monday the XXXX. They still refused to release funds and were indicating their intentions to close my account in spite of me providing all the information they requested. The next morning my mom went to a Wells Fargo branch with all of the information to provide unquestionable proof that it was not fraud.

I received the same letter last year from XXXX XXXX in Client Services, but was able to overturn the decision based on the fact they KNEW me and their issue at the time was incoming wire transfers from XXXX XXXX. I explained that I obtained a job in XXXX XXXX as a XXXX. I was simply transferring part of my salary, once a month, to SunTrust. It was black and white and I told them I could send them my employment letter and proof of income, if needed. A week later, they stated all was well and that my accounts would remain open.   Now, one year later, I received the same account closing letter.   My father wired in {$200000.00} from abroad 3 months ago. My father XXXX and I let SunTrust know the wire was incoming and contacted the branch manager to make sure she was aware and also to let me know if there were any forms or documentation they needed from me.   At that point, the branch manager stated all was well and convinced me to open a money market account to keep part of the money in, which I did. She also stated I should use my checking account more often since SunTrust is such a convenient bank, which I ALSO did. I routed some of my business direct deposits through the account ( since I was a sole proprietor and the business was simply in my name, she stated that would be okay ). I shared with her my online store addresses, which were adequately successful and which were the source of my deposits. So I started receiving my earnings in my SunTrust account and moved things around to make it my primary account.   Next thing I know, two weeks ago, my internet banking could not accessed. I called in and they say a letter has been sent to me stating my accounts were set to close. Reason? None given. I spoke to a VP in Client Services named XXXX XXXX who provided no explanation or reason, and that my account would simply be closed.   This happened after I received {$200000.00} and after I opened a money market account with them, at their request, and after I started receiving my deposits primarily through SunTrust.   The inconvenience this caused was significant and nearly crippling the short term, and the fact they even asked me to open further accounts then closed them was a slap in the face, especially since I 'd also banked with them for so long AND XXXX for them too. My account has been exemplary, no overdrafts, never any issues.   I believe the closing is purely an emotional decision made by someone who did not study my case properly, or someone who has shown bias to an XXXX XXXX name ( even though I am actually XXXX ).

The availability notification ( email ) is not sent until Tuesday morning. Usually this email says some is available Tuesday ( although this is actually 2 business days ). This case had about {$700.00} ( XXXX checks ) deposited Sunday morning. Assuming they would at least be partially available Tuesday, I scheduled bill payments for Tuesday and Wednesday. I received an email Tuesday morning that multiple overdrafts occurred. Then I got an email that my deposit checks would be held for XXXX5 business days from this Tuesday. I called and they said in fact 5 business days from Tuesday, meaning that I made the deposit on XXXX and it would be available XXXX. The reasoning is  too many overdrafts ''.   My issue is that 1 ) I was as never notified that I 've had  too many overdrafts '' and fell into this category. It has never been this way. I have never had a bounced check. How many is  too many ''? Why 5 days instead of XXXX, in XXXX? Why 5 days from Tuesday, not the day the deposit as made? If the deposit availability was clearer, I would never have overdrafts but this cycle just continues.  2 ) the bank should notify me, at the latest, Monday, for a Sunday deposit if there will be a hold l, so that I can not schedule bill payments. This would prevent these overdrafts 3 ) the reason this check is on hold ( overdrafts ) is causing more overdrafts and thus continuing the cycle.  4 ) with this very long hold, there will likely be an overdraft every single day from now until the money is available. A {$25.00} fee each day for the next XXXX8 days, plus the returned payments from the loans/creditors. It will end up costing me more in fees than the original deposit and in the end I will again be negative and overdrafted from the fees, even after the deposits are made available.  All of this could have been prevented and been more fair if the bank had notified me that either my account was in this situation where desposits would be held or notified me in the first 24 hours of making the deposit that this would be the situation. Neither was done, and I assume it was in order to capitalize on the massive fees.  This entire practice is so very unfair. It is my money being held so long and at the bank 's discretion, which they deceptively practice. It continues the cycle of massive overdraft fees and making the bills I try to pay bounce.   This bank also practices processing all outgoing payments prior to all deposits for each day which maximizes their overdraft potential. This has left me with a positive balance for a day even though I ended up with overdraft fees. Again, very deceptive and maximizing these fees, in addition to putting me into an unnecessary category of  too many overdrafts ''. ",kim1845@purdue.edu,0

8220,"This is in response to Case number : XXXX. See bottom for original response.   First, let 's talk credit reporting in general. You are not obligated to report to the bureaus. You are only obligated to report correctly, if you choose to report at all. You most certainly have the legal ability to DELETE the negative reporting. I did not ask you to report it as CURRENT. I asked you to DELETE it.  Second, I asked you to delete it because it was caused by unfair confusion created by your company/products/website and terrible customer service ( no branched, impossible call center, etc. ).  Third, the sole purpose of reporting to the bureaus is to record a debtors commitment and capacity to repay their debts. This single event does not accurately reflect my commitment and ability to repay my debts. Let 's be honest, this is n't even a real debt. This is some horrible overdraft  projection '' on MY checking/savings accounts. This is n't a mortgage ( mine 's current ). This is n't a car payment ( mine 's current ). This is n't a credit card ( mine 's current and with you ... most likely not for long. ). This is n't any other form of consumer loan.  I appreciate you sending me a copy of an electronic statement. Please review the full history of my relationship with your organization. Any other flaws? Any late payments? Of course not. This was an isolated mistake on a horrible product you tied to my bank account. Seems like someone would have called me, emailed me, knocked on my door ... anything.  Again, I 'm requesting this single isolated transaction to be DELETED. Not misreported as Current. This is simple.    Citibank N.A . said : Explanation of closure I understand that you recently requested that the derogatory information reported by Citibank to its subscribing credit reporting agencies for your ( now ) closed Checking Plus account number ending in XXXX, be removed from your credit report. Your prior attempts to have this particular account updated by Citibank have been declined.  XXXX XXXX, it is the responsibility of the Bank to report that which is true and accurate to the credit reporting agencies. Please be assured that Citibank has researched this matter thoroughly and could find no errors in the manner in which your payments were applied to your Checking Plus account. I have also included your monthly statements for XX/XX/XXXX, XX/XX/XXXX, XX/XX/XXXX and XX/XX/XXXX. Our records confirmed that you made a payment on XXXX XXXX, 2015 in the amount of {$430.00}, which was not the full amount billed of {$470.00} as stated in your XX/XX/XXXX statement. No payments were received XX/XX/XXXX and XX/XX/XXXX, which resulted in a late charge being assessed to your account in the amount of {$11.00} on XXXX XXXX, 2015. Final payment of the overdue amount of {$48.00} was received on XXXX XXXX, 2015 and your Checking Plus account was closed. It is for this reason that Citibank is not able to remove the past due reporting on the credit report.

8240,"To whom this may concern, I am in a bit of a unique situation that has severely limited my access to financial services and I am writing this complaint in hopes that a solution can be reached.   By way of background, here is the problem : I am currently located in XXXX but receive physical checks from my freelancing work. These physical checks are delivered to my US address, XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX XXXX, California, XXXX because international mail is both expensive and inconsistent. While I previously had these checks sent to directly to my US bank account, my bank decided, for unknown reasons to close my bank account. As a result, I have been unable to cash about 6 months worth of checks and have been having significant financial troubles. While I could resolve this situation by traveling back to the US and opening up another bank account I am prohibited from doing so because of the associated cost. Despite having over one thousand dollars in soon-to-be stale checks in the US, I am unable to access any of the monies from those checks.   I am writing this complaint in hopes that Chase Bank will provide me with a detailed response on how I can get those checks cashed and gain access to the monies. Thus far I have tried : 1. ) Giving my mother, who is receiving the checks at my former US address, a Durable Power Of Attorney. The bank refused to honor this Power Of Attorney despite it being fully signed and executed. The bank states that I must have the Power Of Attorney notarized, however, XXXX is not a signatory to the XXXX and thus is not allowed to do international notarization. At the same time, the US Consulate provides notarization services but traveling to and from the US Consulate and paying the notarization fee is beyond my financial means.  2. ) Other means such as sending the checks to XXXX, signing the checks, then sending them back to the US and then having my mother deposit the now endorsed check. It works but because of the shipping times involved, some of the checks become stale dated and expired, thus limiting my ability to gain access to my funds. On top of this, the additional shipping costs are unreasonable for small dollar checks.   In review of the California Statutes regarding notarization as listed here : XXXX, I would like to inquire if the bank with allow a signed power of attorney with XXXX witness signatures, in accord with Section 4122. Please promptly advise and I will have a Power Of Attorney signed with XXXX signatures made available to the bank for review.

See attached letter from Citibank. This letter contradicts all discussions I had with Citi at the time I opened the account and at activation. I would not have opened the bank account with Citibank if it was not for this promotion. I am requesting Citi to honor the set promotion. If I was indeed not targeted for the promotion, Citi should have rejected my application for opening the new account using the promo code. And not do it when I have opened the account, met all the necessary requirements and when it comes time to pay out the bonus. They have not acknowledged that if I was not going to receive a bonus it should have been communicated to me during numerous confirmations about the offer. It has been weeks of dealing with this and I am very disappointed that Citi would mislead and treat their customers in this manner. I have been a customer since early XXXX and if this is not handled appropriately I will pursue it further with litigation and no longer do business with this company ever again. I appreciate any help the CFPB can offer to resolve this issue in a timely and satisfactorily manner. Thanks. ",mxuan@purdue.edu,1

On XXXX XXXX, I received a response from XXXX XXXX XXXX stating that Citi confirmed my account was enrolled in the promotional offer. The communication went on to list out my progress toward completing the requirements ( XXXX out of XXXX were completed at the time ), and contained an affirmative statement that the Aadvantage miles would be credited to my account following my completion of the last requirement. On XXXX XXXX, 2016, via secure message, I again contacted Citi to inform them that I had completed the last of my requirements, and sought to know when I should expect the miles to be credited to my account.

Citi 's sudden reversal of position after confirming my eligibility and going so far as to tell me a specific date when to expect the promo miles to transfer to my account is a reprehensible act. They held out an offer to induce my business, I accepted, and even went out of my way to confirm that their records indicated that I had met the terms of the offer, and received such confirmation, only to be told three months later that Citi has now decided not to honor their offer.

This promo code was advertised to give a bonus of XXXX bonus ThankYou Points after opening a new CitiGold account by XXXX/XXXX/2015 and, within 60 days of account opening, post 1 bill payment each month for 2 consecutive months.   Prior to opening the account, I called CitiBank to confirm my eligibility. The representative confirmed that I was eligible, so I signed up on the website. Upon approval of the account, I immediately initiated a re-occurring bill payment, scheduling it once a month for 2 months.  After the second bill payment posted, I called CitiBank. The representative confirmed that I had met the terms of the promotion, and that I would be receiving the bonus points in the next few months.  The points had still not posted in XX/XX/XXXX, so I called back in. The representative again assured me that they would be posting, as I had met the terms of the promotion.  The points still had not posted a couple of months later, so I again called in. This time, I was told that if I had not been targeted for the promotion, I would not be receiving the points, but that they would look into it and send me a letter.  I never heard anything back, so I called again and was told the same thing. This time, I received an email a few days afterwards stating that I was not targeted for the promotion, and would not be awarded the points.  I called back in and informed them that I had been targeted for the promotion, and even if I had not been, they had told me for nearly 6 months that I was eligible and had met the terms. Meanwhile, I was being charged a $ XXXX/month account fee. After being transferred around for just over an hour, I was transferred to the wrong department. Someone at Citi had accidentally transferred me to the department which handles inquiries from Citi employees regarding their employee Citi savings/checking accounts. Despite being confused at how I got there, the representative was very helpful. He again confirmed that the promo code was showing as attached to my account, and that I had met the terms including the bill payment. He promised to have this looked into and said that I would receive a letter in the next week with the outcome of the investigation.  A week passed and no letter. I called back in, and the representative could find no record of the conversation I had previously, and no record of the investigation being initiated. She apologized and promised to follow through with initiating it herself. A few days later I again received an email claiming that I was not targeted and would therefore not be awarded the points.  I called again, and again informed the representative of the ordeal I had been put through, and that I had been told for so long that I was eligible and had completed the terms, and would be receiving the points. This representative was very helpful and promised to escalate the claim.  But again, the same outcome.  Citi does not seem to care what they have told the customer. They do n't care what promises they have made. They do n't care about compensating for telling the customer wrong or deceitful information.

This card was issued by Chase Bank and funded by payroll deductions and employer contributions. On XXXX/XXXX/XXXX I became aware of this activity after observing lower than expected remaining balance while making a payment for a health service. Since there is no monthly statement sent per the card issuer 's policy there was limited means of discovering this fraud earlier. The same day of discovering the fraud I informed Chase Bank of the same who recorded this information and mentioned that I 'll be contacted later. I was later asked to send dispute information in writing which I promptly did.   In the meantime I also contacted the merchant from whom the charges were being sent to my account. I informed them of the fraudulent activity and discovered that there was a fraudulent email address that was on file with them to which they had been billing 4 times monthly since XXXX XXXX. They cancelled the fraudulent membership ( XXXX of them ) on my card and refunded charges for 3 months only.  About a month later I received a call from a person with Chase bank who was assigned to investigate the dispute case. She arranged a 3 way conference call with merchant 's customer service department, who then explained the same information about the fraudulent email address being on-file with the merchant. They could not provide any other information. After that for several months I did not hear anything from Chase Bank about the dispute.

In the denial information recorded in account notes, the 3-way conversation with the merchant and fraudulent email address being found on record with the merchant, was n't even mentioned.   My complaint is that Chase Bank mishandled the dispute and incorrectly denied my claim and never informed me of that denial. ",krohn@purdue.edu,1

Now in XX/XX/XXXX I receive a phone call stating I owed {$170.00} and was late even though I had paid each XX/XX/XXXX, XX/XX/XXXX within the first week of the month.

The manager came on the phone and stated that while the late fee from XX/XX/XXXX had been waived, it was only waived from the total amount due and not what was due for the month. Therefore, I owed {$97.00} plus {$25.00} for the late fee in XX/XX/XXXX and only paid {$97.00}. So in XX/XX/XXXX, I was assessed an additional late fee and again, I only sent {$97.00} so now I owed over {$170.00}.

How can a bank waive a fee and then continue to say it is due and on top of that, charge you late fees for not paying the waived fee?

The demo iron she used worked wonderfully on our hair. She even pointed out how it steamed and it was taking the moisture out of the hair therefore not causing damage. It was supposed to make the hair healthier and not damage it like other irons. I was hesitant at first, but she kept lowering the price and telling me she would give me a GREAT deal. Since the demonstration worked so well I went ahead and purchased the irons. I got home and the next day I washed my hair and used the iron and right away noticed it was nothing close to the one she was using for the demo in the mall. There was no steam and it did n't straighten my hair as fast as the one she used. I went back to the mall and tried to return the products to the merchant and they told me they only would exchange the product for a different one and there were no refunds. Before I bought the irons the return policy was not stated nor was it posted. It was only printed at the bottom of the receipt AFTER I had already purchased it. Red flag right there because most places that sell products will back them up with a guarantee. I explained that I did not want another product that did n't work as advertised.

Although the customer service reps have acknowledged the prior confirmations that I had the promotion and met the terms, they 've told me that they can not assist. They did agree to open an investigation on XXXX/XXXX/XXXX and gave me an expected turnaround goal of 7 business days, but it has now been 18 business days ( 28 total ) and I still have not heard back. They have again charged a monthly service fee to me on XXXX/XXXX/XXXX, which seems to be their end game with this promotion. ",jdenhar@purdue.edu,1
8488,"On XXXX XXXX 2016, I informed M  T Banking that there were several fraud charges on my account from an XXXX customer. These transactions were noted by me on XXXX/XXXX/16 and was reported on XXXX/XXXX/16. However, M  T Bank stated they would investigate the matter and informed me that they would give my money back in a few days.  Five days later, on XXXX/XXXX/16, M  T Bank deposited the stolen money back into my account with the exception of XXXX transaction. I was informed they could not stop the other transactions from going through therefore they credited my account. When they credited my account I assumed it was the money that was illegally taken from my account on XXXX/XXXX/16 and thought nothing of it.  On XXXX XXXX, I received a letter stating that M  T was going to reverse the credit and pull all funds from my account on XXXX/XXXX/16. I asked M  T Bank  Why was this draft or reverse credit taking place? '' They informed me that they never paid the illegal transactions that took place on XXXX/XXXX/16 because they did not receive the required paperwork from the third party. I then asked  If they never paid then why did they credit my account XXXX/XXXX/16? When I viewed my account on the XXXX, it clearly showed the transactions taking place ... this is the VERY reason I called them in the first place. However, when I viewed the account documents, the account showed no evidence of any illegal charges taken place on the XXXX. As a matter of fact the only transactions relevant to this issue noted was the credit on XXXX/XXXX/16 M  T had placed in my account. The problem with this is, if you see the credit on the account, XXXX would most likely ask why is there a credit? M  T could not tell me exactly why the charges fell off the monthly statements which would have have shown why the credit was on XXXX/XXXX/16. I then proceeded to ask why did you credit my account on the XXXX of XXXX for activity that did n't take place on the XXXX/XXXX/16? I told the bank  if you did not pay the charges on the XXXX/XXXX/16, then why the heck did you give me a credit making me think you were simply reimbursing me like you said you would on XXXX/XXXX/16? Now you want to reverse the credit back to M  T on XX/XX/XXXX/2016.This has caused total confusion and obviously documents have been changed or loss to benefit M  T XXXX I do n't understand why it would take 5 days to determine if you are going to pay a transaction or not. Yet on the 5th day and 5 days later you give me the same dollar amount which was originally illegally taken on XXXX XXXX! ( see amount below ) : For the record I called M  T on XXXX  XXXX XXXX and XXXX XXXX and tried to solve the problem. The M  T letter I received was dated XXXX XXXX, 2016. The # is XXXX. Each time I called and spoke to several employees the response was unacceptable. The last person I spoke with was XXXX who identified himself as 'XXXX the Manager '.  Because of these transactions being reversed, this has caused undue stress on my entire family and home expenses. Transactions : All illegally withdrawn on XXXX/XXXX/2016 : {$510.00}, {$510.00}, {$510.00}, {$70.00}. The total amount M  T will reverse are the same numbers and amounts above.  XXXX : Why did M  T credit my account on XXXX XXXX, 2016, when they did not pay the transactions on XXXX XXXX, XXXX? The bank could have just not did anything because I would of not have lost any money, that is, if they did not pull it from my account-right? It looks to me like I am being forced to pay for the illegally transactions, not caused by me, out of my pocket by allowing M  T to revere the credit. Also M  T could not and would not show that the illegal transactions on XXXX/XXXX/16 were not paid which is suspicious banking activity to me. All documents should available for view. I do n't see how the purchase of overseas plane tickets could be reversed! M  T could not show the illegal transactions on my account that happened on XXXX, but was glad to show the credits on XXXX/XXXX/16. ",afrances@purdue.edu,1

Then when pursuing a refinance in the fall of XXXX, it was discovered that HSBC never filed a satisfaction of mortgage for a HELOC that they admitted was paid off in XXXX.

I expected to hear from the bank with my title information but never did. Today I got a call at work from a repossession company stating my car was listed for repossession by 5/3 Bank for nonpayment of my car loan. I explained to them that my car had been paid off since XXXX 2016. Thankfully, they understood that there was a problem with the bank and asked me to contact them directly and were polite enough to give me the account and contact information that I would need.

During this time my address was the same until I sold my house XX/XX/XXXX. The US Postal service still forwards mail and no contact was made to me to discuss additional payments that were not included in the payment booklets. They claimed over the phone that I owed the last 3 payments of a 75 month payment plan. I do not recall agreeing to 75 months but they claimed they had a signed contract from me for that period. They quoted this to me without proof, without sending me the paperwork, or giving me notice that anything was late. I did not have this contract with me to review and was required to pay regardless of whether this was true or not because they had already placed a repossession order on my car. I questioned them why send only 72 months in payments and say  This is your last payment '' in the payment book on 72 when they expected 75 and got no answer. It was not a matter of not being able to pay for it. I paid over {$1300.00} instantly today to avoid the car being repossessed fraudulently.

I now have late payments claimed on my credit history that I consider fraudulent. Why would a bank send payment booklets with less payments than the loan requires? When questioned about this, the bank would not answer. When questioned why nothing was mailed to notify me of their claimed missing payments they claimed they did not have my address.

After speaking with the branch manager, XXXX, she refused and said they would only refund for 3 months service fees. They explained that the account was not free and the banker opened a normal account instead of a student account which is free.   XXXX.

There was no notification of me being charged fees and after asking them multiple times to refund my money they 've refused.

8575,"I have a Direct Express card issued by Comerica Bank on behalf of a XXXX family member 's SSI payments. In XXXX 2016, the card was declined while attempting to make a food purchase. I immediately called the Direct Express customer service number ( XXXX ) to inquire of the account balance and availability. I had been asked to verify my identity by 1 ) stating my Social Security number 2 ) stating my full name, address, date of birth and phone number. Apparently there had been XXXX unauthorized charges made on the card at a department store XXXX miles from my home. The charges were exact to the amount remaining in the account! I was told by the customer service agent at Direct Express that I would need to complete an affidavit and return to Direct Express in order to dispute the charges. Also, my account would be closed immediately and a new card was issued and sent to me at that time. Upon receiving the affidavit from Direct Express, I filled out the forms and returned while patiently waiting for my new card to arrive. Two weeks after my initial call to Direct Express, I still had not received a new card that was supposed to take 5-10 business days to arrive. I called Direct Express and was again asked for the same credentials as before ( SS #, legal name, DOB, address and phone number ). I was informed that the account had not been closed out and a new card had not been issued to me, but my affidavit had been received and part of the funds would be credited to my account. The Direct Express agent would not override expediting the card to me nor would waive the charge for being issued a new card.  Today, I find myself in an eerily similar situation where the newly issued card was used fraudulently. This was discovered when I contacted Direct Express to make a balance inquiry and was immediately transferred to a fraud department. Again, upon being connected I was asked for my SS #, legal name, DOB, address and phone number. The account was zeroed out by a vendor with an unknown name or location. Twice in three months this has happened and I have been even more cautious of using the card while shopping. The customer service agent,  XXXX '' at Direct Express repeatedly spoke over me as I attempted to reconcile the events of what had taken place and ask questions about the processes of recovery. I could not even get a reference number for my case as she abruptly ended the call. Wanting to resolve this, I called again and connected with a different Direct Express agent. Same questions of identity : SS #, legal name, DOB, address and phone number. I explained that I was calling back about my account status, the unauthorized purchases made, and the next steps to resolve the situation. His responses were automated and condescending at one point. It was suggested that I call back in five calendar days to follow up on the charges being settled. At that time he had confirmed a new card had been issued to me and that it should arrive within 5-10 business days.  Having someone violate your personal information and use it is not an everyday occurrence for me and XXXX of other people in this world! Consumers need to understand how companies are protecting our rights and privacy and therefore asking questions is part of that communication.

8596,"I am writing you to lodge a formal complaint against Wells Fargo about multiple overdraft fees from XXXX totaling over {$9000.00}. I am a dedicated online banker.  Last week, my husband made a purchase on XXXX and the pay pal account was linked to my checking account unbeknownst to him. He alerted me that he made a purchase but was unsure what account it was linked. This alerted me to check my account and I was alarmed that it was overdraft by approximately {$650.00}, so I panicked and transferred from our savings account to ensure nothing else would overdraft causing more fees. I checked my account yesterday and was flabbergasted to see that I was negative approximately {$350.00}. So I did some further investigating on my account and noticed that I was getting an overdraft fee for small items as low as XXXX cents and in the month of XXXX alone I was charged about {$1000.00} in overdraft fees. At this point I called the Wells Fargo Customer Service line and spoke with a very kind representative and she said she could only refund me {$260.00} ( give or take. ) I told her that I completely understood her position but that it would not be wise for me to settle when that would still leave my account overdraft and vulnerable to more charges. She completely understood and then transferred me to another representative with more authority. Again, I was treated very professionally and with kindness. Unfortunately she said she would only be able to refund my account around {$650.00}. Please excuse the estimations as I am going by memory. I told her that was a better amount but that I felt that I had been taken advantage of by Wells Fargo and the new overdraft policies that she said I had opted in? I did further investigating on my account and am so sick right now looking at the fees charged so far this year. They total over {$3000.00}. This was money that could have been used to keep my mortgage current, my student loans current and my credit cards current, but now I am in such a hole that I ca n't see the light.   I believe there was a lot of charges accrued due to the way Wells Fargo drafted items out of my account. And it appears that in XXXX there was a change in the overdraft policies. Between XXXX and XXXX fiscal years was charged an average of XXXX overdraft fees per year and between XXXX, I have been hit with XXXX overdraft fees which averages about XXXX overdraft fees yearly affecting my bank account negatively {$290.00} per month. During XXXX to XXXX, I ran a business and was completely focused on that and neglected overseeing my bank account as needed because mainly I trusted WF and could n't possibly fathom that this was taking place and I was being taken advantage of like this.

Here are the details : On XXXX/XXXX/2016, I received a check for {$2900.00} and I deposited it the same day at the local Bank of America branch in XXXX XXXX, CA. The check cleared the next day ( XXXX/XXXX/2016 ) and I withdrew {$2600.00} and deposited that amount to another Bank of America bank account. On XXXX/XXXX/2016 the check for {$2900.00} bounced back and the same amount of money was withdrawn from my account. I called the bank ( spoke to XXXX XXXX ) and they told me to contact the fraud department. I asked the fraud department why the fraudulent check cleared the next day, while other checks take at least a couple of days to clear. She said the reason was I had been a loyal customer and had been given access to the money prior to the clearance of the check. I think this is misleading as I would have never withdrawn the money before the check cleared. As a result, I became the victim of a fraud and I 'm questioning the bank 's policies regarding clearing checks. I was told during numerous discussions with the Fraud department that the bank 's policy is to allow customers to use uncleared funds if their accounts are in good standing ; however, the policy appears to not be applied consistently as it was only applied once, for the fraudulent check I received. All checks I have deposited so far have taken more than XXXX days to clear. The policy was only applied to XXXX check which turned out to be fraudulent and the funds were deposited into another Bank of America account. The bank did not provide information regarding where the funds went or tried to do anything about it considering the money was deposited into another Bank of America account.  In conclusion, I believe that Bank of America 's policies and procedures have caused a loss for the amount of {$2600.00}. With my limited income and as a new immigrant, this is causing me and my family an unbearable financial burden and I 'm unable to pay my rent.  As I have exhausted all other options for resolution, I am writing to you and hoping you could help me understand why the bank 's policies are applied inconsistently. I do not blame the bank for the fraud, I blame the bank 's policies which when applied inconsistently may result in financial loss for the customers. I have also contacted the police which is investigating. ",cthieme@purdue.edu,0

When I approached the teller at the XXXX branch on XXXX, I was met with a very rude woman who refused to help me in any way.

He again directed me to the XXXX number.   My account is now balance is now in the negative by {$550.00}. This is an absurd amount, as I WAS NEVER OVERDRAWN TO BEGIN WITH. Wells Fargo has used manipulation of how they post charges and deposits to my account in an effort to increase their bottom line. I refuse to put money into this account until they make it right and remove these fees ; consequently, they are once again trying to put through charges and now I am at a loss. They are destroying my life and they could care less.   This is precisely the behavior that led us into a recession in 2007, and they are still at it today, as if nothing happened. Worse, they are discriminating against me due to the tyoe of account I have. They are criminals, and they need to be held responsible for their continued unscrupulous behavior.

8781,"Wells Fargo 's last letter to me stated that I willingly put a check in online and it somehow appeared in a specific branch. Upon speaking with a customer service agent of another bank, that is impossible. When a customer takes a picture of their checks, they still have the check itself in their possession. So if you take a picture of your paycheck, and upload it to us bank. It does n't show up in XXXX if you deposit it online or via mobile in XXXX. When it 's a picture taken online or via mobile app, it is still visible to you. Unlike when you go to an actual branch, it is taken from you. But mobile banking and online banking both do n't have any way to put the check in any specific branch. I did not willingly put anything anywhere. Knowing that I have told their representatives I only get ssi, and knowing that nobody gets {$15000.00} in ssi, that would be logical that my account was highjacked. The most one person may get in ssi, may be about {$2500.00} to {$3000.00}, but no more than that. As well as they stated that if you report that funds were put into your account as an unauthorized access to the account, then as long as you report it within 60 days, it should be resolved. If they think willingness, is about giving permission, it is not. If I willingly put {$15000.00} in that account, and making only XXXX a month in ssi, I doubt I willingly put anything anywhere. How can I come up with XXXX, when at most, one could only get {$1300.00} from XXXX payday loan companies? {$730.00} + {$1300.00}, equals nothing close to {$15000.00}, and the person who put it in there is XXXX XXXX, in XXXX, I do n't think that 's logical. And also, they state that in their funds availability policy, that any amount over {$5000.00}, is to have the first {$200.00} available the first business day after that was deposited, well then if that be the case, mine were available the first day they were put in. XXXX XXXX is the check issuer, but that check holder is XXXX in XXXX. And by federal law, he should be in prison for committing a purposeful fraud against wells Fargo. But wells Fargo looks at me for fault, when the last time I 've travelled outside of XXXX, is when I was a very going minor child. The check was unclear to me online. I do not know any XXXX XXXX, with XXXX XXXX in XXXX. Willingness is not permission. If what they state is true, then why was the check from an XXXX account, and XXXX address.

8783,"When I left my last employer, my 401k account had been transferred to Wells Fargo. I had no idea that it had been transferred to Wells Fargo until I called the original company that was managing it because their statement had fees and I wanted to know more about the fees.   After getting in touch with Wells Fargo, I instructed them to close the account and send me the funds in the account. I had barely {$200.00} in that account and I was being charged the equivalent of about XXXX % every quarter. When I made my request over the phone, I was instructed to prepare a written request, fill out a several page form and even get one of the documents notarized! I have never had to do so much work to get my own money back.   They were clearly doing everything possible to make it hard for me to obtain my funds. To give some perspective, I was laid off from a job in XX/XX/XXXX, where I had a 401k balance of about {$85000.00} that was managed by a more reputable and friendly firm. I only had to log into my 401k account online and make a request. Within one week, I was mailed a check for the entire amount. No questions, no written requests, no documents to get notarized.   After I went through all this trouble, I received my check in the mail and observed that I had been charged the equivalent of about XXXX % of my balance! There was not statement, no explanation, just a check for about XXXX % of my balance. To say that I am livid is an understatement. This is abuse, and this is coming on the heels of Wells Fargo being issued fines by your very agency for shady behavior. Well it seems that they are still up to no good, abusing customers and squeezing us for fees wherever possible.   I am fortunate that I am not in a financial situation to be impacted by this behavior, but many Americans do not enjoy my position, and these outrageous and what SHOULD be illegal fees must be addressed.   I would very much like you to go back to Wells Fargo and investigate their practices with respect to managing ( or fee farming ) 401k accounts. Your assistance would be greatly appreciated.

Finally, an employee got back to me about my overdraft case via telephone, but the line got disconnected, and the man never called me back.

As a small business owner, I 've been building my client base and have conducted mostly smaller transactions. Four weeks ago, I received a very large wire deposit from a client. It was my company 's largest sale to date. After the funds cleared, I attempted to send payments as wire transfers to all my vendors, none of which went through. That is what alerted me to the issue. Chase did not contact me with any fraud alerts. I just stopped having access to the account. At first, Chase explained that they identified some fraudulent activity. They were concerned that my account had experienced a large spike in activity. I was asked, then verified all charges as legitimate. The Chase rep stated that my account would be cleared by next business day. Still no access by next business day. When I followed up, the Chase rep then stated that they were investigating the source of the large wire transfer and I had to provide all of my invoices and tax returns to prove that I was a legitimate business. They did not provide this information willingly, though. Chase stated that under the Patriot Act, they do not have to explain themselves. However, I provided all requested documents. To date, I had been in business for over 2 years. Chase then stated I had to wait 10 business days for the investigation to clear. I did and the account was still frozen. After doing some searching regarding people who have experienced similar situations with Chase, I found that Chase had an Executive Customer Service office dedicated to solving out-of-ordinary issues.

Upon following up again, they said I did not fulfill the agreement, and I was supposed to pay bills with their online bill payment system, not with the brand new gold debit card they gave me.  I have yet to find what they are basing this on, and I was clearly not aware of this, nor the branch where I opened it ever instructed me to do so.   Multiple disputes were denied, although, most reps I spoke with, said I deserved those points.  With every denial, I got a letter, saying if I want to reach out to them, I should call customer service, which is total useless, as they ca n't do anything. Sometimes they were rude, sometime nice, but always clueless, and powerless to do anything, resulting a loop, where I can never present my case.   Giving up on their  justice '', I closed the account, and now I am waiting to receive my check for the remaining balance. This check did not arrive yet, but I heard stories ( on their facebook page ) that those check are a hassle as well.

They identified with my situation, and were very understandable.  In our conversation a compromise was brought up, that I will pay two future months bill payment via the online service in order to complete the requirements ( as seen by the promotional team ).

Since then, I have been trying to prove that I in NO way authorized these charges and that my debit card and cell phone had been taken and used without my consent. They have been extremely unhelpful and I question their integrity. I have been at BOA since 2013 and have been pretty consistent with my banking and ( almost always ) on time with my payments. If you try to fully understand the details of the situation and what occurred, as well as what I was thinking, and the circumstances surrounding the situation ( the timeline ), the non- legitimacy of the charges become apparent. The fact that as of now, I have lost all of my savings and owe {$500.00} ( plus my BOA credit card bill ), while having to pay my {$1000.00} on my XXXX bill, is very unfair. Talking about the specific charges, I went ahead and filed police reports. These are with the XXXX PD. For lost property, this includes the debit card and phone : XXXX and for CC Fraud : XXXX, this includes all fraudulent charges ( including {$400.00} ATM withdrawal ). Bank of America has twice denied my claim ... with no communication on their end as to why. They have not contacted the police and have done very little research on the charges or the facts. This is almost all of my money and it is extremely stressful and unfair. Please help put pressure on Bank of America. This is theft. ",wu467@purdue.edu,1

9058,"On XXXX/XXXX/2016 I lost my debt card issued by Regions Bank. I noticed the card missing on XXXX/XXXX/2016 and reported it lost via telephone. At around XXXX the banker over the phone shut down the debt card and took my current address and stated that a new card was going to be shipped to my new address. I also disputed some fraudulent charges that were made on the account. I also requested to be taken of the overdraft program and not to honor any charges if there 's no funds in the account. This was requested in order to prevent overdraft fee ( {$36.00} each ). On XXXX/XXXX/2016 I called regions bank and request a status on the new card and report that there is automatic payments that are hitting my account and causing the account to get overdraft charges. I explained to them that I was waiting for them to send the new card along with the results of the dispute. I then get XXXX different version of what happened to the card. The first was that the card was going to be mailed to my new address. The second is that they cant send me a card because I have to go into a branch and show them ID and proof of address, and the last that the card was issued to the old address and that it was canceled. I asked about all the overdraft charges and they said that they cant do anything about it, that my dispute was denied, that I have allowed other people use my card. So I am stuck with the theft and the over draft charges. I even ask them to stop payment on all accounts as I originally have requested but they said that they cant do that either. Every time I requested to speak to a supervisor something would happen to the line or it would ring for about 20 mins and then hang up. The last conversation was that a compliant was file with Regions, that the fees will remain, and that I have to go in to a branch. After almost two hours of my time, I got no where and now I have to take time from work and go in person and see if this can be resolved. I am very upset with Regions Bank, they lied to me, made me wait for a card for 15 days when in fact it was never shipped to the correct address and due to this error there is {$260.00} in overdraft fees. I really do n't think this is fair. ",mcarrasc@purdue.edu,1
9060,"I was a victim of this Wells Fargo matter : http : XXXX XXXX Wells Fargo banker named XXXX ran my credit without my permission to open a business line of credit. As a result, a credit inquiry was charged against my credit report ( s ). I called Wells Fargo shortly after this happened, and Wells Fargo stated that they were unable to remove the unauthorized credit inquiry from my credit report ( s ). ",xie188@purdue.edu,0
9061,I have had an account with BB  T since before XX/XX/2007 with no fees. I had no activities so I rarely looked at my account statement. After 8+ years of no fees some time this year my account has been assessed fees greater than {$100.00}. I feel it bad practice and possibly against banking regulations to arbitrarily begin feeing a customers after years of no fees.   I made no changes and was not notified of the new fees placed by the bank. With the XXXX XXXX scandal I want to make you aware to make sure your bank is not following the same path.   I feel I was robbed of my money just like a bank robber now it seems the bank is the robber. ,ahbruns@purdue.edu,0
